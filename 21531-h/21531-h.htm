<h2>EDITORIAL FOREWORD</h2>

<p>To be successful in woodwork construction the
possession of two secrets is essential&mdash;to know
the right joint to use, and to know how to make that
joint in the right way. The woodwork structure
or the piece of cabinet-work that endures is the
one on which skilful hands have combined to carry
out what the constructive mind planned. And it is
just here that the present Volume will help, not alone
the beginner who wishes preliminary instruction, but
also the expert who desires guidance over ground
hitherto unexplored by him.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this new edition the Publishers
have secured the services of Mr. William Fairham, by
whom the chapters have been carefully revised and
re-illustrated. Although intended for the practical
man, and not professing to be a graded course of
"educational woodwork," the Volume is one which
Handicraft Instructors will find of the greatest value
in conducting woodwork classes. No book hitherto
published contains such a variety of illustrations of
joints, almost all of which will form suitable exercises
of practical educational importance in a woodworking
course.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GLUED_JOINT" id="THE_GLUED_JOINT"></a>THE GLUED JOINT</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he glued joint in its various forms is in use in every
country in the world, and is frequently met with in
mummy cases and other examples of ancient woodwork.
Alternative names under which it is known
are the butt joint, the rubbed joint, the slipped
joint, whilst in certain localities it is known as the
slaped (pronounced <i>slayped</i>) joint.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 482px;"><a name="f001" id="f001"></a>
<img src="images/f001.jpg" width="482" height="130" alt="Fig. 1.&mdash;Simplest Form of Glued or Rubbed Joint." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Simplest Form of Glued or Rubbed Joint.</span>
</div>

<p>The glued joint is made by planing two pieces of
timber so that when placed together they are in contact
with each other at every point; they are then usually
united with glue. <a href="#f001">Fig. 1</a> shows a sketch of a butt joint
in its simplest form. In <a href="#f002">Fig. 2</a> is indicated the method
of holding the joint whilst being glued; the upright
portion is held rigid in the bench vice, thus leaving the
left hand to hold the piece which is to be jointed, whilst
the right hand operates the glue brush. The pieces of
wood which form a butt joint may be glued together
with or without the aid of cramps or artificial pressure.
If the joint is to be made without cramping, the two
surfaces of the timber are warmed so as not to chill the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
glue. The surfaces are then glued and put together
and rubbed backwards and forwards so as to get rid of
the superfluous glue. They are then put aside to dry.</p>

<p><b>Glueing.</b>&mdash;The better the glue penetrates into the
pores of the wood, the stronger the joint will be; for
this reason timber of the loose-fibred variety, such as
pine, etc., will hold up at the joint better than hardwoods
like teak and rosewood. The glue used for
jointing should be neither too thick nor too thin; the
consistency of cream will be found suitable for most
purposes. It should be nice and hot, and be rapidly
spread over the surface of the wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;"><a name="f002" id="f002"></a>
<img src="images/f002.jpg" width="445" height="125" alt="Fig. 2.&mdash;How the Wood is held whilst Glueing." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;How the Wood is held whilst Glueing.</span>
</div>

<p>If light-coloured woods, such as pine, satinwood,
sycamore, etc., have to be jointed, a little flake white
should be procured and mixed into the liquid glue.
This will prevent the glue showing a thin black line
on the joint.</p>

<p>Broad surfaces of close-grained hardwood having a
shiny surface are usually carefully roughened with a
fine toothing plane blade previous to glueing.</p>

<p><b>Supporting the Joint.</b>&mdash;The jointed boards should
not be reared up against a "bench leg" or wall without
having any support in the centre, as dotted line at
<a href="#f005">Fig. 5</a>, because in all probability they will fracture
before the glue has time to set; and, when we go to
take them up to renew working operations, we shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
annoyed to find that they have assumed a position
similar to that at <a href="#f005">Fig. 5</a> (shown exaggerated), and this
will, of course, necessitate re-jointing.</p>

<p>A correct method to adopt is seen at <a href="#f006">Fig. 6</a>. Here we
have supported the joint by rearing up against the wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
a couple of pieces of batten, one at each end of the
board, thus supporting it throughout its entire width
until the glue is thoroughly set. The two or more
pieces of timber in a butt joint adhere by crystallisation
of the glue and atmospheric pressure. A well-fitted
joint made with good quality glue is so strong that,
when boards of 3 feet and upwards are jointed together
by this method, the timber in most cases will break
with the grain sooner than part at the joint.</p>

<p>Butt joints may be cramped up, if desired, and it is
customary to warm them as previously stated. In the
absence of the usual iron cramp, the amateur may make
an excellent wooden arrangement out of any odd
pieces of timber that happen to be handy. Two blocks
of hardwood are screwed on the base board at a suitable
distance for the work in hand; the boards to be
jointed are glued and placed in position between the
blocks; and the two hardwood wedges are inserted and
hammered in opposite directions to each other, thus
exerting the desired pressure. An example of this
method of cramping is shown in <a href="#f025">Fig. 25</a>, which also
indicates the use of iron "dogs."</p>

<p>When jointing, care should be taken to first plane up
the boards true on one side&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, take them out of
winding. The method of testing for this is shown at
<a href="#f009">Fig. 9</a>, and it may with advantage be used when
jointing the edges of the boards. Two laths or strips of
wood are planed up to exactly the same width, having
their edges straight and parallel. One edge of each
lath may, if desired, be bevelled a little. The method of
using these "twist sticks" or "winding laths" is to
put them on the board as indicated, and sight along
their top edges. The winding laths, being much longer
than the width of the board, show up the irregularity
greatly pronounced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Tools</b> generally used for making the butt joints
are:&mdash;</p>

<p>The jack plane, for roughing the edges, etc.</p>

<p>The wooden trying plane (or iron jointing plane) for
trueing up the work.</p>

<p>The try square for testing purposes.</p>

<p>The winding laths and straight edge.</p>

<p><b>The Method of Work</b> is as follows: Each board is in
turn put in the vice and planed straight lengthwise; it
is then tested with winding laths and a try square (the
latter method is shown at <a href="#f022">Fig. 22</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;"><a name="f009" id="f009"></a>
<img src="images/f009.jpg" width="443" height="201" alt="Fig. 9.&mdash;Testing Surface with Winding Laths." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Testing Surface with Winding Laths.</span>
</div>

<p>The boards are then put on the top of one another as
at <a href="#f001">Fig. 1</a> and tested with a straight edge; they should
appear true as shown at <a href="#f003">Fig. 3</a>; if they show faulty as
at <a href="#f004">Fig. 4</a> the joints must be again fitted until the
required degree of accuracy is obtained. Difficulties
may be avoided by care in selecting timber suitable for
jointing, and it must be remembered that timber
shrinks circumferentially (the heart side becoming
curved) as dotted lines in <a href="#f010">Fig. 10</a>. If the timber be
jointed with all the heart side one way as at <a href="#f010">Fig. 10</a>,
the tendency will be for it to cast as shown by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
dotted line. If the timber be alternated as at <a href="#f011">Fig. 11</a>,
the tendency will be to cast wavy, whereas if quartered
timber can be obtained it will stand practically
straight as the tendency to shrink is in thickness only.
The grain of quartered timber is shown in <a href="#f012">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Judgment should also be exercised to avoid jointing
in which one piece of timber is wild and large in the
grain, and the adjoining piece of a mild-grained nature.
Jointed boards should always be glued up with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
grain running in the same direction if possible; this
we show at <a href="#f013">Fig. 13</a>, and nothing looks worse than a
dressing chest end or similar piece of work in which the
grain runs haphazard. When jointing thin timber (say,
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in., <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-in., <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-in. and <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-in. boards) the best method is to
use a shooting board (<a href="#f026">Fig. 26</a>). It must be noted, however,
that a shooting board and plane practically never
give a true right angle, owing to wear and the grinding
of the blade. Therefore, the boards <i>should not</i> all be laid
with the "face mark" on the shooting board whilst the
edges are shot, because any inequality would be multiplied
by the number of pieces jointed. A better method is
to alternate the boards, face side up, then face side down,
whilst shooting the edges; this will prevent convexity
or concavity on the face of the jointed board, because
any slight error in the angle is neutralised (see <a href="#f008">Fig. 8</a>).</p>

<p>Owing to the importation of narrow and faulty
timber the necessity of jointing is greater to-day than
ever it was, wide timber of course meaning higher cost
for raw material.</p>

<p>The method of using iron dogs is illustrated in <a href="#f025">Fig. 25</a>,
and it will be observed that owing to the wedge-like
formation of each fang (see enlarged sketch) the dog
exerts the necessary pressure to close the joint. At the
centre of this illustration is suggested the home-made
hardwood blocks, baseboard and wedges referred to on
<a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#f027">Fig. 27</a> shows how the iron sash cramps are used to
apply pressure to the joint. As this method is in some
cases apt to bend and distort thin boards it is wise
practice to fix (as a temporary measure) a stout piece
of straight wood on to the board to be joined by using
two handscrews as shown at the left hand of the illustration.
At the right hand of the sketch a wooden
cramping arrangement of the box type is given, and
by wedging up the boards are closed together. It is
obvious that if this type of box cramp be used it will
prevent the boards buckling and the handscrew method
at the left may be dispensed with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span> he halved joint is frequently known as half-lapping,
and sometimes as checking and half-checking.
In the majority of cases it is made by
halving the two pieces, <i>i.e.</i>, by cutting half the
depth of the wood away. There are, however, exceptions
to this rule, as in the case of "three-piece
halving" (or, as it is sometimes called, "third lapping")
and in the halving of timber with rebated or moulded
edges. Halving is one of the simplest methods of connecting
two pieces of timber, especially where it is
desired to make frames and bracket supports for either
inside or outside use.</p>

the frame where the two pieces form a right angle
(see <a href="#f028">Fig. 28, 1</a>). Each piece is halved and shouldered
at opposite sides, thus forming a perfect fit one with the
other and giving a strong joint with a minimum amount
of labour. For inside work the joint would be glued
and screwed together, the screw heads being countersunk
so as not to come in contact with the cutting iron
of the plane when levelling off the work. For outside
work, in exposed positions where the work will have to
withstand the weather, the alternative method of
smearing the joint with paint or with a mixture of
varnish and white lead would be advisable, the joint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

three pieces separated is shown at L, B, C, <a href="#f046">Fig. 46</a>.</p>

<p>This joint is extensively used in the pattern making
trade for lap-jointing the arms of pulley patterns, etc.
It is probably the most difficult of the halving joints
to mark out and construct with the desired degree of
accuracy.</p>

are: planes, the gauge, tenon or other saw, chisels, try
square, and in some cases a joiner's bevel to obtain and
mark the necessary angles, pencil and marking knife.</p>

<p>Plane up the face side and face edge of the timber,
gauge and plane to both thickness and width; mark
shoulders with pencil or marking knife; gauge to the
thickness of the required halving; saw waste portions
away; pare up with chisel to a good fit; glue or glue

then level off the surfaces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Setting out the Halved Joint.</b>&mdash;Although at first sight
the halved joint may appear to be a very easy
item of construction, it requires much care and attention
in marking out and sawing. <a href="#f062">Fig. 62</a> shows the two
pieces which form the joint separated, and it will be
noticed that each piece of wood has half its thickness
cut away, so as to accommodate the other piece. This
type of joint is used where two pieces of wood cross each
other at right angles, or at an angle as shown in <a href="#f051">Fig. 51</a>.
The halving joint is used also for joining two pieces of
wood at their ends, as, for instance, the corner of a frame,
one half of this joint being shown at <a href="#f065">Fig. 65 (<span class="smcap">B</span>)</a>.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 64.&mdash;Marking the Joint with Try Square.</span>
</div>

<p>To make the joint, the timber should be carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
planed to its exact width and thickness. The two
pieces may then be placed upon the bench (as shown at
<a href="#f063">Fig. 63</a>) or fixed in the vice.</p>

<p>Find the centre of the timber, C, <a href="#f063">Fig. 63</a>, and set
out half the width of the wood on each side of the dotted
centre line. Thus, suppose the wood (W) to be 2 ins.
wide, then set 1 in. on each side of the centre line. Take
a square as at <a href="#f064">Fig. 64</a>, and with a sharp penknife blade
score or cut a line all round each piece of timber.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 65.&mdash;Using the Marking Gauge.</span>
</div>

<p>Next take up a marking gauge, and set the marking
point to half the thickness of the wood. The distance
may be measured, and its exactness tested, by pricking
a small hole from each side of the wood with the marking
gauge and carefully noting that the pricked holes
coincide. The gauge mark is clearly shown in the
various illustrations. Now, take a pencil and scribble or
mark "waste" on the parts you intend to cut away. This
will save trouble later on, especially if you are making
several joints at once. Take your sharp penknife or
marking knife blade, and cut fairly deeply into the
marked line on the portion you are going to pare away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Fix the wood firmly in your vice, or against your
cutting board or bench stop, as may be more convenient
to you, and with a sharp chisel cut away the
wood up to the marked line, as at <a href="#f066">Fig. 66</a>. The channel
in the sketch is exaggerated, so as to show the method
clearly. The object of using a penknife or marking
knife to mark your work, instead of using a pencil, will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
be obvious. Owing to the knife having scored about
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span> in. deep across the fibres of the wood, the timber
will come away cleanly when the chisel is used, as at
<a href="#f066">Fig. 66</a>. The small channel thus made will form a
guide in which to start your tenon or dovetail saw; it
prevents the saw cutting on the wrong side of the
marked line and thus making the halving too wide.</p>

<p><b>Sawing.</b>&mdash;Lay the work on the cutting board as at
<a href="#f067">Fig. 67</a>; or, if you prefer, put the work in the vice.
Carefully saw down the work until you <i>just touch</i> the
gauge line. Do not press heavily with the saw; use it
lightly; the weight of the back iron which is fixed on
the saw will ensure the saw feeding into the work quite
fast enough. If the saw is newly sharpened it will, in
fact, be an advantage to slightly ease the weight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
saw from off the wood, owing to the keenness of its edge.
If the halving is a very wide one, additional cuts may
be sawn between the outside marks, and these will
greatly facilitate the removal of the waste wood when
paring it away. For sawing the joint reference may be
made to the chapter on <a href="#THE_DOVETAIL_JOINT">Dovetailing</a>.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 70.&mdash;Sawing the Cheek of a Halving Joint.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Paring</b> away the waste material with a chisel is the
next step, and this is shown at <a href="#f068">Fig. 68</a>. The work may
be chiselled either in a vertical or a horizontal position.
The horizontal position is the easiest for the amateur
who has a vice or handscrew, because he may hold the
work securely with a mechanical device and so avoid
the unnecessary risk to his fingers.</p>

<p>Take the chisel and cut away A, <a href="#f068">Fig. 68</a>; now turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the chisel and cut away B; after which keep the chisel
horizontal and cut off "the top of the hill," as it were, C.
Repeat the three operations until you gradually pare the
wood away exactly to the gauge line. When chiselling,
if you find a tendency for the work to chip or crumble at
the back edge owing to the forward pressure of the chisel,
turn your wood round and begin to cut from the other
edge, allowing the chisel to finish paring at the centre.</p>

<p><b>Joints Other than a Right Angle.</b>&mdash;If the halving
joint is at an angle similar to the sketch shown at
<a href="#f069">Fig. 69</a>, great care will have to be exercised in the use of
the chisel, owing to the change in the direction of the grain
of the wood. The arrow marks in this sketch distinctly
indicate the direction in which the chiselling must be done
so as to give a smooth result. This change of direction for
cutting also applies to the bottom of the halving joint.</p>

<p><b>Cutting Joint at End of Timber</b> (<a href="#f070">Fig. 70</a>).&mdash;Should
the halving joint be used at the end of a piece of wood,
as at <a href="#f030">Fig. 30</a>, the waste material may be roughly sawn
away and the flat surface trimmed up with a chisel.</p>

<p>To saw out this type of halving joint, proceed to work
the shoulder line as already described; then place the
piece of wood obliquely in the vice as shown (<a href="#f070">Fig. 70</a>)
and proceed to saw down the vertical line, carefully
watching the gauge line to see that you saw on the <i>waste</i>
side of the lines. Then turn the piece of timber with
its opposite edge towards you, and again use the saw as
illustrated. You will this time only have to watch the
gauge mark on the edge of the wood, because the saw will
readily follow in the saw kerf already made. Now place
the wood vertically in the vice, and keeping the saw in
a horizontal position, saw down to the shoulder line.</p>

<p>Halving joints properly made and fitted should knock
together with the weight of the clenched fist; the use
of a heavy mallet or hammer will deface the work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_BRIDLE_JOINT" id="THE_BRIDLE_JOINT"></a>THE BRIDLE JOINT</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>  bridle joint is often defined as the reverse
of a mortise and tenon, and is chiefly used in the
carpentry and joinery trades. The name probably
originated from the fact that it bears some resemblance
to the manner in which a bit slips into
the horse's mouth and is fastened to the bridle.
There are fewer varieties of the bridle joint than of the
halved or the mortise and tenon; and this being the
case we may take the opportunity of giving a few
detailed directions, with explanatory illustrations, on
the setting out and the making.</p>

<p><a href="#f072">Fig. 72</a> shows a bridle joint in what is perhaps its
simplest form, the separate pieces being given at the
left and the completed joint at the right. A joint of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
this type may be applied in nearly all cases where a
halved or a mortise and tenon joint could be used.
Bridle joints have an advantage as regards appearance
over the mortise and tenoned variety in cases such as
<a href="#f073">Fig. 73</a>, which shows an occasional table leg fitted to
the circular top framing. The bridle joint here allows
the grain of the leg to run through to the top, and gives

<p><b>Setting Out and Marking.</b>&mdash;It is a safe rule, when
setting out a bridle joint, to divide the thickness of the
timber into three equal parts. This will leave the
timber on each side of the tongue equal to the thickness
of the tongue, thus giving uniform strength to the
joint. The bridle joint is chiefly used for connecting
the internal parts of wooden frames. It is stronger
than the halving joint, and, owing to its peculiar
construction, requires little in the way of pegs, screws
or nails to secure it in position. <a href="#f081">Fig. 81</a> illustrates the
joint, both open and closed.</p>

<p>To understand the method of setting out and marking,
glance at the sketch, <a href="#f081">Fig. 81</a>. It is not necessary
that the bridle piece A be the same width as the cross
piece B; but it must be remembered when setting out
the joint with the marking knife or pencil that the width
marked W on piece B must be equal to the width W
on the piece A. The timber should be fairly accurately
sawn or planed to the same thickness, and all edges
should be square and true.</p>

<p>The wood is placed upon the bench, and the joint
marked out by using a marking knife or penknife blade
and the try square. A knife blade is much better than
a pencil, as the sharp edge severs the fibres of the wood
and gives a finer line than the pencil. It is not always
necessary to exactly square and trim the end of piece A;
it may with advantage in many cases be left at least
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. longer than necessary and levelled off with the saw,
plane and chisel after the joint is put together. (See
Method of Cutting in <a href="#f092">Fig. 92</a>, page 47.)</p>

<p>When the piece A has to have a bridle joint fitted at
each end, it is customary to cut the timber about
<span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. longer than necessary, and mark the shoulder
lines C to the exact length, after which the joints are
cut. This leaves the ends standing over the horizontal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
rails, and, after fixing the complete frame together, the
small projecting ends are levelled off flush with the
cross rails.</p>

<p><b>Gauging.</b>&mdash;After squaring all the shoulder lines round
the timber with the knife and try square, the mortise
gauge should be set so as to strike the two gauge lines
marked G, <a href="#f083">Figs. 83 and 84</a>, at one operation. If the
worker does not possess a mortise gauge the lines may
be marked at two distinct operations with the aid of
the marking gauge (<a href="#f082">Fig. 82</a>). The gauge should be
adjusted so as to mark the wood into thirds, and the
stock of the gauge (the portion of the gauge containing
the thumb screw in <a href="#f082">Fig. 82</a>) must be used from the face
side of the timber when gauging up the whole of the
pieces forming a frame. The face mark on the work
is indicated by a glorified comma, and the edge mark
is shown by X, as in the various illustrations. <a href="#f082">Fig. 82</a>
shows the method of holding the gauge in the right
hand whilst gauging the lines on the work.</p>

<p><b>Boring Away Waste.</b>&mdash;Examine <a href="#f084">Fig. 84</a>; the shaded
portion in the centre has to be cut away, and it will
greatly facilitate the removal of this waste piece by
boring a hole with a twist bit at the position shown.
The twist bit should be about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. less in diameter than
the width between the gauge lines G. The easiest
method of boring out this hole is shown at <a href="#f085">Fig. 85</a>,
which gives the correct position of the worker.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 85.&mdash;Vertical Boring previous to Chiselling.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Sawing.</b>&mdash;The wood should be put in the vice as
<a href="#f086">Fig. 86</a>. Taking up a saw, with the index finger on the
side of the handle, commence sawing, and proceed until
you come to the position indicated by the dotted hand
and saw A; this will leave a saw kerf or cut running
diagonally from the shoulder line to corner of the wood.
Release the vice and refix the wood so that it leans in
exactly the opposite direction to <a href="#f086">Fig. 86</a>; then reverse
your own position and repeat the sawing, so as to cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
another diagonal saw cut from the shoulder line to the
corner. Fix the wood upright, as shown at <a href="#f087">Fig. 87</a>,
and saw as shown, when you will find that the saw has
no tendency to run out of the guide cuts already formed
by the method used at <a href="#f086">Fig. 86</a>. Remember, when
commencing to saw at <a href="#f086">Fig. 86</a>, that it is necessary to
saw inside the gauge line; otherwise the joint will be
too slack, owing to the amount of sawdust removed by
the thickness of the saw blade. The index finger on the
side of the saw, pointing in the direction of the saw cut,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
will greatly help the worker to saw in a straight line,
as it is natural to point with this finger to any object
that is to be aimed at.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 86.&mdash;How the Saw is held for the first Cut.</span>
</div>

<p>Cut down the other line in a similar manner, and then
with a chisel of suitable width carefully chop away the
waste material. The wood may be placed edge way
upon the bench, or in the vice, and the chisel should be
held vertically. The hole which has been bored with
the twist bit will allow the chips which are cut away to
offer little or no resistance to the chisel blade. The
chiselling should not all be done from one side, or a
chipped under-edge will be the result; it is better to
chisel the work until half-way through and then turn
the other edge of the wood uppermost and again begin
to chisel from the top. This method will finish the
cutting in the centre of the work and prevent burred
and ragged or chipped edges at the shoulder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Cutting the Shoulders.</b>&mdash;With regard to working the
piece B, <a href="#f081">Fig. 81</a>, place the wood against the bench stop
or in the vice, and taking up a <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in. chisel carefully cut
away a small channel, as shown at <a href="#f088">Fig. 88</a>; treat the
other shoulder lines in a similar manner. If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
marking knife or penknife blade has been used with a
fair amount of pressure so as to score the fibres of the
wood, this small channel, which is to form a guide for
the saw, will quickly and easily be cut. Next place
the wood in the vice or on the cutting board as shown
at <a href="#f089">Fig. 89</a>, and begin by sawing lightly at the back edge
as shown. When the saw has entered the wood <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in.
gradually bring the handle down from position A
to position B (dotted lines) whilst the saw is in
motion. Continue sawing until just on the gauge line;
then treat the other shoulder lines in a similar manner.</p>

<p><b>Chiselling away Waste.</b>&mdash;Fix your wood firmly in
any suitable manner, vice or otherwise, and, holding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
your chisel tilted as at <a href="#f090">Fig. 90</a>, pare away the blacked
portion 1; then pare away the blacked portion 2;
after which hold the chisel flat and by gradual operations
pare away the dotted lines 3, until you come
down to the gauge line; then repeat the method of
cutting on the opposite side of the wood. If any difficulty
be experienced by chipped or ragged edges whilst
chiselling, it can easily be overcome by chiselling alternately
from the outside of the wood, so that the finish
of the chisel cut takes place in the centre of the work.
Some prefer to chisel away the waste by placing the
wood on its edge and using the chisel vertically instead
of horizontally. The same methods (1, 2 and 3) hold
good in this case.</p>

<p><b>Joints Other than at 90&deg;.</b>&mdash;The two pieces forming
a bridle joint are not always at right angles, as at
<a href="#f081">Fig. 81</a>; in many instances it is necessary that the
joint be at other than 90 degrees. The work, however,
is treated in a similar manner, with the exception that
an adjustable joiner's bevel is used instead of a try<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
square to mark out the shoulder lines, and that a
change of direction in the grain of the wood will occur
when chiselling out the work. <a href="#f091">Fig. 91</a> indicates the
change in the grain of the wood, and the adjustable
joiner's bevel is also shown.</p>

<p><a href="#f098">Fig. 98</a> is an example of matchboarding that is
tongued, grooved and vee'd on one side, and <a href="#f099">Fig. 99</a>
shows tongued, grooved and vee'd both sides. These

<p>The object of working a bead or beads on matchboarding
is to break the jointing of the various pieces
and to aim at ornamental effect; also to prevent unsightliness
should the timber shrink slightly. When a
moderate amount of shrinkage takes place, as is nearly
always the case, the joint at the side of the bead appears
to the casual observer to be the fillet or channel worked
at the side of the bead. If the tongues are not painted
before the work is put together, the shrinkage will cause
the raw wood to show and thus make the joint too
much in evidence.</p>

<p><b>Cabinet-work Joints.</b>&mdash;With regard to tongued and
grooved joints which apply more particularly to the
jointing of cabinet work, <a href="#f093">Fig. 93</a> is produced by planes
which are specially made for the purpose. One plane
makes the tongue and another the groove.  The
handiest sizes to buy are those which joint <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in., <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in.,
and <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. timber, it being usual to dowel or loose-tongue
thicker boards. The <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. partitions (or, as they are
sometimes called, dustboards) between the drawers of
a sideboard or dressing chest are in good work jointed
in this manner. The <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. and <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. ends and tops of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
pine or American whitewood dressing tables, wardrobes,
etc., call for the larger sized plane.</p>

<p><b>Loose Tongues.</b>&mdash;There are two methods of jointing
with loose tongues, viz., the use of the cross tongue,
<a href="#f103">Fig. 103 A</a>, and the use of the feather tongue, <a href="#f103">Fig. 103
B</a>. Cross tongues are the stronger when glued in their
position and can be used very much thinner than
feather tongues. Feather tongues are cut diagonally
across the grain as illustrated.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#f105">Fig. 105</a> is a cradle for planing up loose tongues to
the required width (generally <span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in.). Two grooves are
made in a piece of 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. hardwood; one groove is used
for planing the width way of the tongue and the other
for planing the edge way. These tongues can be cut
to accurate size on a circular saw bench if power and
machinery are at hand.</p>

<p><b>Applications of the Joint.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f106">Fig. 106</a> is a sketch of a
portion of a sideboard top, showing the plough groove
ready worked out to receive the tongue; the other half
of the top is treated in a similar manner. It will be
noticed that the groove is not worked through the full
length of the board, but stopped about 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. from each
end; this leaves a square joint at each end of the top
on which the moulding is worked. If the groove be
run through the board it looks very unsightly when the
mould is finished.</p>

<p><a href="#f107">Fig. 107</a> is a shaped spandrel, such as is fixed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
recess of a sideboard or cupboard or shop window fitment.
It is of such a width that, were it cut from a wide
board, the shaped portion would be apt to break off
owing to the short grain at C. The shaping is therefore
built up out of three separate pieces, the grain running
as indicated. The loose tongue is represented by the
dotted line and a section is shown of the joint at the
line A B. At the opposite corner the tongue is left
blind, <i>i.e.</i>, not run through the edge. This is the
method that should be used when the shaping is above
the level of the eye.</p>

the marginal frame stands above the top just
the amount of the thickness of the leather which will
cover the table. In some cases the margin at the end
runs the same way of the grain as the top, thus allowing
for slight shrinkage. Cross tongues would of course be

for strengthening the corners of cabinet work, such as
tea caddies, small boxes, plinths, etc. Two pieces of

joint for fixing together the sides of a corner bracket,
and the same method holds good when jointing a

<p><b>Ploughing.</b>&mdash;When grooves have to be worked in the
edge or face of a board to receive tongues, the process
is generally called ploughing, and it is usually accomplished
by a special tool called a plough (or, as it is
occasionally spelt, "plow"). When a plough plane is
bought it is usual to procure eight plough bits or blades
of various sizes to fit the plane. In <a href="#f121">Fig. 121</a> is given

<p>The board or boards which it is desired to groove are
first planed straight and true, exactly as though it were
desired to make a glued or butt joint. One of the
boards is now placed edge way up in the vice and with
the face side to the worker.</p>

<p>Take the plough plane and select a suitably-sized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
blade; fix it in the plane in the usual way, allowing the
cutting edge to project beyond the steel skate about
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">32</span> in., and securely drive up the wedge. Next loosen
the small boxwood wedges at the side of each stem, and
adjust the plane by tapping the stems with a hammer
until the cutting iron is in the desired position; then
knock up the small wedges nice and tight. When
setting the fence to or from the blade it is a wise precaution
to measure the distance from the fence to the
skate at each end of the plane; this will ensure the
skate being parallel to the fence. The neglect of this is
a source of annoyance to many amateurs. Now adjust
the depth stop by turning the screw at the top of the
plane, measuring the depth of the required groove
from the edge of the blade to the stop, and carefully
lock the screw which adjusts this stop.</p>

<p>The plane is now ready for use. Hold the fence close
up to the side of the timber, the hands in position as
shown at <a href="#f122">Fig. 122</a>, the position of the body being that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
generally assumed in planing. Move the plane backwards
and forwards in the usual manner, beginning the
cut at the end of the board nearest to the vice jaws (the
front), and proceed with the planing until the depth
stop is in contact with the wood. Then take a step
backwards and repeat the process until the whole
length of the groove is ploughed. Care must be taken
to force the fence up to the board with the left hand,
whilst the right hand thrusts the plane backwards and
forwards, and the plane must be kept vertical.</p>

<p><b>Tongueing.</b>&mdash;The grooves having been completed,
the tongues have to be made. <a href="#f123">Fig. 123</a> shows a sketch
of a board and the method of marking out cross
tongues (A) and feather tongues (B). The usual procedure
for making cross tongues is to plane the end of
the board and use a cutting gauge to give a line the
required distance from the end (see sketch). The
board is sawn with a tenon or panel saw, and the piece
of timber for the tongue is thus procured. If a feather
tongue is to be used it is cut diagonally from the
board (B) and the ends cut square as shown by the
dotted line.</p>

and Feather Tongues." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 123.&mdash;Method of Marking Out for Cross Tongues
and Feather Tongues.</span>
</div>

<p>Feather tongues can be obtained in fairly long lengths
out of narrow boards, whilst on the other hand cross
tongues are limited by the width of the board. After
cutting off the tongues, they require planing with
nicety to fit the grooves, and the advantage of a grooved
board (<a href="#f105">Fig. 105</a>) will be appreciated. A glue spoon
similar to a plumber's ladle is generally used to pour
the glue into the grooves, and it is customary to glue
the tongue into one board first; after allowing this to
set, the joint is completed in the usual manner.</p>

of tenons as used in thick timber which is to be veneered
on the face. A temporary piece of wood (A) is put
between the tenon cheek and the saw, thus forming a
guide for the latter. After cutting one saw kerf a
thicker piece is made and a second saw kerf cut; the
waste between the saw kerfs is now removed with an
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. chisel and this completes the groove. A tongue
of this type acts as an extra tenon and prevents the
joint from "lipping" (becoming uneven) on the face
side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>  mortise and tenon joint is the method of
joining timber by working a solid rectangular
projection in the one piece and cutting a corresponding
cavity to receive it in the adjoining
piece. The projection is called the tenon, and the
cavity the mortise. Joints of this type are
secured in various ways. Small wedges, wooden
dowels, metal dowel pins, glue and paint are frequently
used, and prior to the introduction of glue we have
examples of Egyptian furniture in which the mortise
and tenon joints were united by a composition of cheese.</p>

<p><b>Barefaced Tenons.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f127">Fig. 127</a> illustrates the joint in
its simplest form and shows a tenon having only one
shoulder. This is called a barefaced tenon, and it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
be noticed that the portion which carries the mortise
is thicker than the rail on which the tenon is cut. The
joint is therefore level (or flush as it is called) on one
side only, and it should never be used at the corner of a
frame. It is a useful interior joint for framing that has
to be covered on the back side with matchboarding,
and allows the work to finish level at the back when the
boarding has been applied (see plan, <a href="#f127">Fig. 127</a>).</p>

<p><b>Stub or Stump Tenon</b> (<a href="#f128">Fig. 128</a>; also occasionally
called a joggle tenon).&mdash;The illustration shows a tenon
as used in the interior of a frame. The tenon is not
allowed to run through the stile, and unslightliness on
the edge is thus avoided. This type of tenon is often
used at the corner of a frame, and it then requires to be
haunched. A good workshop method of gauging the
depth of the mortise for a stub tenon is shown in <a href="#f129">Fig.
129</a>; a piece of gummed stamp paper is stuck on the
side of the mortise chisel, indicating the desired depth
of the mortise. This greatly facilitates the work, as it
is not necessary to be constantly measuring.</p>

<p><b>A Haunched Tenon</b> as used at the end of a door frame
is shown at <a href="#f130">Fig. 130</a>.&mdash;In this case it will be seen that
the width of the tenon is reduced, so that sufficient
timber will be left at the end of the stile to resist the
pressure of the tenon when the joint is driven together.
The short portion (A) which is left on the tenon is called
the haunch, and the cavity it engages is termed the
haunching. The haunch and haunching prevent the
two pieces of timber lipping, or becoming uneven on
the face side, as would be the result if it were cut away
entirely up to the shoulder.</p>

<p><a href="#f131">Fig. 131</a> shows the type of tenon and haunch used
when the stile or upright rail is grooved to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> a
panel. In this and similar cases the haunch is made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the same width and the same depth as the groove; the
groove therefore acts as the haunching. An application
of this joint is shown in the top rail of the door
frame, <a href="#f132">Fig. 132</a>.</p>

<p>This type of joint is also used to connect the rail to
the leg of an ordinary kitchen table (see <a href="#f167">Fig. 167</a>).</p>

<p>A joint used for inside framing is seen at <a href="#f134">Fig. 134</a>.
The rails may be used as shown, but in the case of a
door frame (as <a href="#f132">Fig. 132</a>) they would have the inside
edges grooved to receive the panels; the tenons would
therefore be slightly narrower than shown, owing to the
groove at each edge.</p>

<p><b>Sprocket Wheel.</b>&mdash;At <a href="#f139">Fig. 139</a> are shown the guide
bar and chain of a chain-mortising machine, two
enlarged links of the chain being indicated at A. The
chain is similar in construction to the driving chain of a
bicycle, with the exception that it is provided with
teeth which cut away the timber as the chain revolves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
When using a chain mortiser the portion of the machine
carrying the chain is fed downwards into the timber,
thus cutting a clean and true mortise. If, however, a
stump mortise is required it is necessary to pare away a
certain amount of timber by hand, because the machine
obviously leaves a semicircular bottom to the mortise.
To overcome this difficulty the latest types of mortising
machines have a square hole-boring attachment fixed
alongside the chain. This tool, the working portion
of which is illustrated in <a href="#f140">Fig. 140</a>, consists of a square
hollow chisel (E), which is sharpened from the inside,
and a revolving twist bit (D) fitted with spurs or nickers,
but without a point (one spur can be seen at the bottom
of the illustration). This bit revolves inside the shell
like a chisel, and bores away the superfluous timber,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
whilst the pressure exerted on the chisel causes the
corners to be cut away dead square. A mortise <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in.
square by 6 ins. in depth may thus be cut. The portion
marked A is the shank of the chisel (<a href="#f140">Fig. 140</a>), where it
is fixed into the body of the machine, and the hole at
E allows the boring bit to free itself.</p>

amateur. It is necessary to use this joint when both
the stiles and uprights are rebated, and it calls for
accurate marking out and great care in the making.</p>

<p><a href="#f145">Fig. 145</a> indicates faulty methods of working a tenon.
At A the saw has been allowed to run too far when

At B faulty sawing has again occurred, and to remedy
this defect the worker has resorted to paring the
shoulder with a chisel. Had the chisel been used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
vertically an undercut shoulder (as at B) would not have
occurred. The trouble now is that the slightest amount
of shrinkage in the width of the stile will show an open
joint. The result will be the same if it is necessary to
remove a shaving or two when planing or levelling up
the face of the frame.</p>

bench are required to be held together by a mortise and
tenon, and to be readily taken apart, the tenon is dovetailed
on one side and the mortise is made of sufficient

is slightly dovetailed and two saw cuts are made in the
tenon about <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span> in. from each side. Into each saw kerf
a wedge is inserted and the joint glued up. The
cramping operation forces the wedges into the saw
cuts, thus causing the end of the tenon to spread and
tightly grip the mortise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

the face edges have moulds worked upon them. If the
joint has square edges a rebate may be formed to
accommodate a panel by fixing a bolection moulding
around the frame. A section of the bolection mould
planted on the frame is shown in the lower figure.</p>

<p><b>Drawbore Pinning.</b>&mdash;At <a href="#f162">Fig. 162</a> is seen the method
of securing a tenon by drawbore pinning, employed
when it is not convenient to obtain the necessary pressure
by using a cramp. The joint is made in the usual
manner, and a <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-in. twist bit is used to bore a hole
through piece A. The tenon is driven home and the
hole is marked on the side of the tenon (B); the tenon
is then withdrawn and the hole bored about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. nearer
to the shoulder than as marked on the separate diagram<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
at C. When the tenon is finally inserted the holes will
not register correctly, and if a hardwood pin be driven
into the joint it will draw the shoulders of the tenon
to a close joint and effectually secure the parts.</p>

<p><b>Sash Bars.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f165">Fig. 165</a> shows how to tenon a moulded
sash bar to the rebated cross rail. In this illustration
both shoulders of the moulded bar are shown square,
but in the best class work these shoulders may be
slightly housed into the cross rail to prevent side play.
This type of joint is used for horticultural buildings, etc.
If the lower rail be moulded with the same members as
the sash bar, the end of the sash bar will have to be
scribed on to it to make a fit.</p>

<p><b>General Rule.</b>&mdash;In practically all cases where a single
tenon is used the thickness of the tenon should be one-third
the thickness of the timber. This leaves the
timber at each side of the mortise the same strength as
the tenon.</p>

<p>Mortise and tenon joints for inside work may be
united with glue. If, however, the work has to stand
the weather a better method is to unite the joint with
white lead, which is run down to the required consistency
with good outside varnish.</p>

<p><b>Setting Out the Joint.</b>&mdash;The principal use of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
mortise and tenon joint is in the construction of various
types of framing, such as door and window frames. In
one or other of its many and varied forms it may be
classed as the most important joint in the general woodworking
trade. The joint may be used as an internal
one, as shown at the lower rail, <a href="#f176">Fig. 176</a>, or as an
external joint, as the upper rail of the same illustration.</p>

<p>Whatever type of framing has to be made, it is necessary
that the face side of the wood be planed up straight
and out of winding, and the face mark (as shown in
<a href="#f176">Fig. 176</a>) pencilled upon it. The best edge of the
timber should next be planed up true in length, and
square to the face side, and the edge mark (X) clearly
placed upon it.</p>

<p>The marking gauge is now set to the desired width,
and gauge lines are marked on the wood, after which
the waste wood is planed off until the timber is the
required width. The thickness is gauged and treated
in a similar manner, except in such cases where the
finished work is to be of a rough and ready character.</p>

<p><b>The Two Stiles</b> (or uprights) have their faces turned
to touch each other, as shown at <a href="#f177">Fig. 177</a>, and their
length may be anything from 1 in. to 3 ins. longer than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the required finished size. This waste wood at each end
of the stiles (see arrow HO) is of importance to the
work, as it prevents to a great extent the bursting of the
mortise whilst cutting the hole or when knocking together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the work. The small projection is called the "horn,"
and it is cut off after the frame has been put together.</p>

<p><b>The two Cross Rails</b> (<a href="#f177">Fig. 177</a>), have their faces
placed together as shown in the sketch. These rails
may with advantage be left <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. longer than the
finished size, and the portion of the tenon (which will
protrude through the stile <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. at each end) may be cut
off after the work is put together. (See <a href="#f092">Fig. 92</a>.)</p>

<p>Set out the stiles with a marking knife or penknife
and a try square, as shown at <a href="#f178">Fig. 178</a>. In this sketch
only one stile is shown for clearness of representation,
but two or more stiles (as at <a href="#f177">Fig. 177</a>) may be marked
out at the same time, provided a 12-in. try square be
used; in fact, marking out the stiles in pairs is to be
recommended, as all cross lines will be exact owing to
their being marked at the same operation. The cut
made by the marking knife should be lightly carried all
round the work as the mortising is cut from each edge
of the stile, the cutting of the mortising being finished
in the centre. The lettering on <a href="#f177">Fig. 177</a> is as follows:&mdash;HO,
horn; M, position of mortise; H, position of
haunching; A, inside line, or sight size, as it is occasionally
called.</p>

<p>Set out the cross rails as at <a href="#f177">Fig. 177</a>, lower sketch.
The lettering in this figure is as follows:&mdash;T, tenons;
the small piece of the tenon lettered J is called the
haunch, and the shaded portion H is cut away to allow
the haunch J to fit the haunching of the stile.</p>

<p><b>The Tenons</b> (as already stated) are generally one-third
the thickness of the timber, thus leaving the same
amount of substance at each side of the tenon as the
tenon itself is composed of. The mortise gauge is set
to the required distance and used as in the case of the
marking gauge (<a href="#f082">Fig. 82</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>To saw the tenons, place the rail in the vice as at
<a href="#f179">Fig. 179</a> and, with a panel, tenon, or hand saw, according
to the size of the work, cut down the outside of the
tenon line as shown. Reverse your position and cut
as shown at <a href="#f180">Fig. 180</a>, then place the rail in a vertical
position, and you will find little or no difficulty in sawing
down square with the shoulder line. Repeat the
above methods of sawing until all the tenons are sawn.</p>

<p>Next saw out the pieces at the side of the tenon by
the following procedure. Place the rail against the
bench stop, or in the vice, and cut a small channel in
which to run your tenon saw as shown at <a href="#f181">Fig. 181</a>. If
you have scored the line deeply with your knife when
you were marking out the work, you will have little
difficulty in removing a small portion with the chisel.
The amount removed in the illustration is, of course,
exaggerated. In the small channel thus made place the
tenon saw and, guiding the saw blade with the finger
so as to keep it upright or square (<a href="#f182">Fig. 182</a>), saw away
the waste material. Remove the waste material at the
sides of the tenons in a similar way, and then saw out
the portion marked H, <a href="#f177">Fig. 177</a>, lower sketch.</p>

<p><b>The Mortising</b> of the stiles may next be taken in hand
by putting the stiles edgeways in the vice and boring
away the bulk of the waste wood from the mortise with
a suitable-sized twist bit and brace. This method will
save a great amount of noise, as to a great extent it does
away with the use of the mallet. Take the mallet and
chisel and chop down about <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. as shown at <a href="#f183">Fig. 183</a>;
then turn the chisel to the position shown at <a href="#f184">Fig. 184</a> and
remove the small piece as shown. Continue these two
operations until you are about half-way through the
wood and then start in a similar manner at the line <i>a</i>,
<a href="#f183">Fig. 183</a>, after which turn the other edge of the timber

clearly shows the methods of working. In many woodwork
examinations the examiners insist that the mortise
shall be removed by successive cuts with the chisel, but
we certainly advise the removal of much of the waste
wood with a boring bit, provided the worker can keep
straight and well within the limitations of his gauge lines.</p>

<p><b>Removing Haunching.</b>&mdash;After removing the mortise
hole, the small portion which is called the haunching

tenon joint separated; it is used in cases where a
straight joint is required on the upper or lower edge of
the work, whereas the upper rail of <a href="#f176">Fig. 176</a> shows the
full haunch on the top edge. In cases such as <a href="#f187">Figs 187
and 188</a>, where the edges of the frames are grooved to
receive panels, etc., the width of the tenon is reduced by
the width of the groove.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>This must be remembered by the worker when marking
out his stiles with the marking knife. <a href="#f187">Fig. 187</a>

at the bottom. Tenons may be glued together and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
wedged as shown at <a href="#f176">Fig. 176</a> if for inside work; but if
for outside work they are generally smeared with thick
paint and wedged up. For light-class cabinet work
it is usual to cut the mortise about seven-eighths of the
distance through the stile and make the tenon to match
it; the edge of the finished work does not then show
any indication of the joint, and it leaves a nice clean
surface at the edge of the work for polishing or
varnishing.</p>

<p><b>Interlocking Chair Joint.</b>&mdash;A joint designed with a
view to strengthening the construction of chairs at the
point where they are weakest is shown in <a href="#f189">Fig. 189</a>. The
joint is an interlocking one so arranged that, once the
chair is glued up, no motion of the side rail can be
possible. The groove in the side rail tenon is cut in
such a manner that, on the insertion of the back rail
tenon, the joint actually draws up and, having done so,
is locked in position. The exact location of this groove
is obtained in a similar manner to that used in marking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
out tenons for drawbore pinning, <i>i.e.</i>, the tenon is
inserted in its mortise and the position of the back rail
mortise transferred to it, after which the lines are set
back by <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">64</span> in. (approximately) to cause the joint to
draw.</p>

<p>From the illustration the construction of the joint
should be clear. The method is particularly adapted
to a section of rectangular form where one side is longer
than the other, such as the back leg of a chair, as this
shape allows for the accommodation of the extra length
of tenon required.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_DOWELLING_JOINT" id="THE_DOWELLING_JOINT"></a>THE DOWELLING JOINT</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>owelling is the term generally given to the
method of jointing timber and other materials by
wooden or metal pegs, which are called dowels.
For cabinet-making and similar work straight-grained
beechwood dowels are mostly used;
these may be bought by the gross, in lengths of
about 36 ins., and of any desired diameter.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Making Dowels.</b>&mdash;Many, however, prefer to make
what they require for the work in hand, and the following
is the method that is generally employed. Pieces
of straight-grained wood are wrought to a square
section, after which the corners are planed away to form
an octagonal section. The sharp corners are now
planed away, and the roughly formed dowel is driven
through a steel dowel plate, <a href="#f190">Fig. 190</a>, by the aid of a
heavy hammer, thus giving the necessary roundness
and finish to the dowels. When hammering dowels
through a plate the hammer should on no account be
allowed to come in contact with the face of the dowel
plate, or the cutting edge of the hole will be spoilt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Simply drive the dowel to within <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. of the plate and
knock it out with the next dowel.</p>

<p>To plane off the corners a "cradle" (<a href="#f191">Fig. 191</a>) is
made and kept for the purpose. The advantage of this
cradle is obvious, preventing as it does any tendency
of the partly-formed dowel to slip or wobble. A jig, or
cradle, is easily made by bevelling the edges of two
separate pieces of wood and then glueing and screwing
them together as at <a href="#f191">Fig. 191</a>. A small block of wood
is inserted to act as a stop whilst the planing operation
is in progress. It is usual to bevel both edges of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
timber from which the cradle is formed, thus accommodating
all sizes of dowels from <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. to <span class="above">5</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. in diameter.</p>

<p><a href="#f192">Fig. 192</a> shows a completed dowel with a small groove
running along its entire length. The object of this
groove is to allow the air and superfluous glue to escape
and thus avoid splitting the work on hand; the groove
also secretes a certain amount of glue, which increases
its hold on the timber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#f198">Fig. 198</a> illustrates the method of marking out and
gauging two boards for dowelling. The edges of the
boards are first shot to a true joint; then the face sides
are placed together and the lines for the dowels are
marked across the edges with a fine pencil and the aid
of a try square. The boards are then gauged from the
face side, thus giving the points indicated in the sketch.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 197.&mdash;Twist Bit.</span>
</div>

<p>To start the twist bit (<a href="#f197">Fig. 197</a>) it is a good plan to
prick the board at the point of intersection of the
marked lines with a sharp, circular-pointed marking
awl. This obviates any tendency of the boring bit to
run out of truth and thus cause unevenness on the face
side of the jointed board. (See <a href="#f194">Fig. 194</a>.)</p>

<p>A safe rule for the spacing of dowels when jointing
sideboard tops, dressing table and wardrobe ends, etc.,
is to place the dowels 9 ins. to 10 ins. apart, and place
two dowels at each end as shown at <a href="#f198">Fig. 198</a>. The
length of the dowels should be about <span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. to 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. long.</p>

<p><a href="#f199">Fig. 199</a> shows the two boards prepared ready for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
glueing. The back one is bored to receive the dowels,
and the front one shows the dowels glued in position.
It is customary to warm the edges of the boards before
spreading the glue, and cramps are required to squeeze
the joint tight. These should be left on the jointed
board from one to four hours according to the state of
the weather.  In cases where thick timber (say 2-in. or
2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-in. boards) is to be jointed, two rows of dowels may
be used, the position of the dowels being as <a href="#f200">Fig. 200</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#f201">Fig. 201</a> shows the plan of a 3-in. cornice pole made to
fit a bay window; the straight portions of the pole are
generally turned in the lathe, the corner portions being
afterwards jointed and worked up to the required shape.
To avoid any difficulty in the setting out of the dowels,
a disc of cardboard or sheet metal is made to the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
diameter as that of the cornice pole; this disc is called
a template. The positions of the dowels are set out
geometrically, and the centres are pricked through with
a fine-pointed marking awl (see sketch of template, <i>a</i>,
<a href="#f201">Fig. 201</a>). The template is put on the ends of the
straight pole, and the dowel centres are pricked into the
wood. The process is repeated on the ends of the corner
block (<i>b</i>, <a href="#f201">Fig. 201</a>), and if the holes be now bored at the
centres indicated a true fit will be obtained.</p>

frame. It needs little or no explanation beyond the
fact that the dowels should be at right angles to the
line of joint, and consequently the dowel at the outside
edge of the frame will have to be much shorter than the
others. This gives a strong and serviceable joint, suitable
for many purposes.</p>

<p><b>Frame Dowelling.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f203">Fig. 203</a> shows one corner of a
frame with long and short shoulders, such as occurs
when the upright is rebated through its entire length.
The holes in both pieces are bored for the dowels before
they are rebated. This avoids any difficulty in endeavouring
to bore with only one side of the twist bit in the
wood. A similar type of joint is used on nearly all
kinds of glass and door frames in cabinet work.</p>

<p><a href="#f204">Fig. 204</a> is a leaf for the screw type of table. Circular
dowels are shown at one end, and rectangular wooden
pegs at the other; both methods are equally good, and,
of course, the dowels are only glued into one leaf. The
object of these dowels is to guide the table leaf into its
proper position when the leaf engages the table proper,
and to make the flat surface of the table top and leaf
register correctly and thus ensure a level surface.</p>

<p><a href="#f205">Fig. 205</a> is a wooden block made in two portions and
held together by screws; it is used to fasten around a
twist bit, the object being to ensure that all the dowel
holes are of uniform depth. It may be adjusted as
desired and firmly screwed round the twist bit; if the
hole is made <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. in diameter it will clip round a <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in.
or <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-in. bit and will answer a dual purpose. It is a
preventative for bad dowelling.</p>

<p><a href="#f206">Fig. 206</a> is an example of dowelling framing when the
moulding on the edge has to be mitred. It is necessary
to cut the shoulders away so as to allow the members
of the moulding to intersect. The section of the mould
is not shown in the sketch for clearness of representation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
The portion marked H is called the "horn," and
it is not cut off until after the frame is glued up; its
object is to prevent the rail splitting or bursting when
knocking up the frame or during the cramping process.</p>

<p><a href="#f207">Fig. 207</a> shows the method of dowelling a moulded
cap to the top of a wooden bedstead post or similar

manner.</p>

<p><a href="#f209">Fig. 209</a> shows the top portion of a table leg and a
home-made dowel gauge. The gauge is made of any
hardwood, and steel wire pins are driven through at the
required positions and sharpened similar to the spur of
a marking gauge. The legs are sawn and planed up
true and square, and the advantage of the gauge is that
all legs are marked exactly alike and are therefore interchangeable
until glued up. A gauge of this type is
easily and quickly made and may be kept for its specific
purpose or altered for other work.</p>

<p><a href="#f210">Fig. 210</a> indicates the Queen Anne type of leg, a
sketch of same broken below the knee also being given.
Here we have another type of irregular setting out,
which is accomplished in the following manner. Saw
and plane the broken portion of the leg true as shown;
take the timber which is to be jointed and treat it in a
similar manner; now place four ordinary pins on the
lower portion. Carefully place the top portion to the
required position and smartly give it one tap with the
hammer; this will cause the pin-heads to leave indentations,
and if these be taken as centres for boring, accurate
work will result. The new portion of the leg is
afterwards sawn and wrought to the desired shape.</p>

<p>This is an example of work where it is next to impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to use a gauge, and as only one joint is required
it is not worth the time taken to make a template.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SCARF_JOINT" id="THE_SCARF_JOINT"></a>THE SCARF JOINT</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he method known as "scarfing" is used for the
joining of timber in the direction of its length,
enabling the workman to produce a joint with a
smooth or flush appearance on all its faces. One
of the simplest forms of scarfed joint is known as
the half lap, in which a portion is cut out at the
end of each beam or joist, equal in depth to half the full
depth of the beam, and of equal length to the required
scarf.</p>

<p>The two pieces before they are placed together form a
joint as shown at <a href="#f211">Fig. 211</a>, the projecting part (A) fitting
into the recessed portion marked B and the two pieces
being secured in their respective positions by screws.</p>

<p><a href="#f212">Fig. 212</a> shows a dovetailed scarf joint. This is a
variation of <a href="#f211">Fig. 211</a>, the length of the dovetail lap
being from 6 ins. to 8 ins. in length.</p>

<p><a href="#f213">Fig. 213</a> is an illustration of a joint designed to resist
a cross strain. The face side is left flush, whilst the
underside is assisted by an iron plate. The joint is
secured with nuts, bolts, and washers. This type of
joint is frequently used for joining purlins in roof work;
the iron plate on the underside is in this case omitted.</p>

<p><a href="#f214">Fig. 214</a> is designed to resist both tension and compression
and is an excellent joint for all purposes. The
joint is brought together by using folding wedges as
shown in the centre.</p>

its production is somewhat costly, and this may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> be
the reason that it is not more universally used. Folding

</div>

<p><a href="#f216">Fig. 216</a> is a scarfed joint with undercut vee'd ends
which prevent the joint from lipping up or down or sideways.
It is a useful joint, calling for careful setting out
and accurate craftsmanship. Folding wedges are used
in this case to draw up and secure the joint.</p>

<p><a href="#f217">Fig. 217</a> is a "fished joint," and the following difference
between a scarfed and fished joint should be noted.
A fished joint need not necessarily reduce the total
length of the beams to be joined, and fish plates of
wood or iron (or a combination of both) are fastened at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
each side of the joint. In a scarf joint all surfaces are
flush. In <a href="#f217">Fig. 217</a> the beams are butt-jointed and
secured by wooden plates and iron bolts. The upper
plate is let into each beam, and the lower plate is provided
with two wooden keys to prevent the beams
sliding (or "creeping") upon the lower plate. Iron
nuts, bolts, and washers are used to complete the joint.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 217.&mdash;Fished Joint.</span>
</div>

<p>In the case of the scarfed joint at <a href="#f218">Fig. 218</a> (used
for purlins) the length of the scarf is usually made
about four times that of the depth of tie beam. It has
two hardwood keys which force the pieces together
and thus tighten the joint.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 218.&mdash;Detail of Scarfed Joint in Purlins.</span>
</div>

<p>The methods of scarfing and fish-jointing are many
and varied, and, in selecting a joint, the nature of the
pieces to be joined and the direction and the amount of
the load should be carefully taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The above joints come under the heading of carpentry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and the ordinary tools such as the saw, plane,
boring-bit and chisels are all that are requisite and
necessary to produce a sound and serviceable joint.
Scarfed joints are generally of large size, and they are
usually made by placing the work upon sawing trestles
owing to the bench being too small to accommodate the
large timbers.</p>

<p><a href="#f219">Fig. 219</a> is a tabled scarf joint which admirably
resists tension and compression. It is very easy to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
make and fit, and is not materially affected by shrinkage.
The rectangular wrought iron straps are knocked
up over the joint after the two pieces engage. The
length of the joint should be approximately five times
its thickness.</p>

<p><a href="#f220">Fig. 220</a> is an example of a lapped scarf joint which
is secured with nuts and bolts. It effectively resists
compressional stress in vertical posts and it may, if
required, be strengthened by the addition of wrought
iron fish plates. It is quite a serviceable joint for all
general purposes, such as shed or garage building where
fairly heavy timbers are used.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_HINGED_JOINT" id="THE_HINGED_JOINT"></a>THE HINGED JOINT</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne of the most common forms of hinged joint in
use to-day is that formed by using the "butt"
hinge, and many troubles experienced by the
amateur, such as "hinge-bound," "stop-bound,"
and "screw-bound" doors, etc., are due to a lack
of knowledge of the principles of hingeing.
Hinges call for careful gauging and accurate fitting,
otherwise trouble is certain to occur.</p>

<p><b>A "Bound"</b> door or box lid is said to be hinge-bound
when the recess which contains the hinge is cut too
deep. The frame and the body portion engage too
tightly when closed, the result being that the door has
always a tendency to open a little. This fault may be
in many cases remedied by packing behind the hinge
with one or two thicknesses of good stiff brown paper.
For packing purposes such as this paper will be found
to be of much more value than thin strips of wood or
knife-cut veneer, the latter always having a great
tendency to split when a screw or bradawl is inserted.</p>

<p>A stop-bound door is the name applied when the door
is not finished to exactly the same thickness as originally
intended. This causes the door to bind on the
stops at the back, as shown at <a href="#f221">Fig. 221</a>. The difficulty
may be remedied by thinning the door a little at the
back, or slightly rounding away the portion which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
binds.</p>

<p>Screw-bound is a common fault often overlooked by
the amateur. It is caused by using screws of which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
heads are too large for the countersunk holes in the
hinge, and may be avoided by slightly sinking the holes
in the brasswork with a countersink or rose-bit.</p>

<p><b>Alignment.</b>&mdash;Another fault that is fairly common is
having the axes of the hinges out of alignment. Especially
is this the case when three hinges are used to hang
a wardrobe or other large door. It is absolutely
necessary in all cases that the exact centres of the
pivot-pins of the hinges should be in a straight line.</p>

<p>Particular attention to alignment is necessary when
the body and the door frame are shaped on the face side.
A familiar example that every reader may inspect for
himself is the curved side of a railway carriage body and
railway carriage door, where he will notice that a specially
wide hinge has to be used at the bottom of the door
to give the necessary alignment. Hinges fixed on work
with their centres out of truth are often overlooked by
the inexperienced worker, and this is a frequent cause of
creaking.</p>

<p><b>Gauging.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f222">Fig. 222</a> is a sketch of a brass butt hinge,
open. <a href="#f223">Fig. 223</a> illustrates a similar hinge closed, and
shows the gauge set so that the point of the marker is
exactly to the centre of the pivot-pin. This distance
we will call C. Now turn to <a href="#f224">Fig. 224</a>. The distance C
has been gauged from the face side of the frame. The
gauge is then set to the thickness of the hinge at its
thickest portion, and to prevent "hinge-bind" see that
the gauge is set on the <i>fine</i> side. Remember that the
tapered point of the steel spur or marking awl will part
the fibres of the timber a little more than the fine point,
and give you a wider gauge line than was anticipated
when you set the gauge. The inexperienced worker
nearly always overlooks this. The result is a hinge-bound
door, the cause of which is not discovered by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
worker because he is so sure that he has set the gauge
correctly. The distance B, <a href="#f226">Fig. 226</a>, shows the line
gauged for the thickness of the hinge.</p>

<p><b>Position of Hinges.</b>&mdash;Another difficulty to the
beginner is the position for his hinges, and it may here
be stated that the general rule is to carry a line across
the face of the work from the inside of the cross rail and
place the hinge at E, as <a href="#f224">Fig. 224</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;"><a name="f226" id="f226"></a>
<img src="images/f226.jpg" width="467" height="329" alt="Fig. 226.&mdash;Tool Operation when Paring Out the Hinge
Recess in the Door." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 226.&mdash;Tool Operation when Paring Out the Hinge
Recess in the Door.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Sawing for the Recess.</b>&mdash;After marking out for the
hinge, as shown at <a href="#f224">Fig. 224</a>, take a fine-toothed saw (a
dovetail saw is considered the best) and saw down as
shown at <a href="#f225">Fig. 225</a>, care being taken not to cut beyond
the gauge lines. In this sketch three intermediate saw
kerfs are shown, but if the hinge is of great length, say
5 or 6 ins., the removal of the waste wood will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
greatly facilitated by the addition of more intermediate
saw kerfs. These cuts sever the cross fibres and allow
the timber to be easily pared away in short lengths.</p>

<p>In <a href="#f226">Fig. 226</a> we see the tool operation when paring out
the hinge recess. At the left of the drawing the recess
is shown marked. Take a <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. chisel and, using it as a
knife (see A), deepen the gauge lines. Then stab the
chisel downwards, as at B, to deepen the end lines.
Next, take the chisel and pare away the back of the
recess as at C. The work may then be completed by
paring neatly till the bottom of the recess is flat.</p>

<p class="caption">The Hingeing of a Box Lid.</p>

<p><b>Stopped Hinged Joints for Box Work.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f227">Fig. 227</a> is
a section through a small box similar to a lady's work-box
(the back of the box in the illustration is enlarged
in thickness to clearly show the position of the hinge).
In this case the knuckle of the hinge is let into the woodwork
until it is flush with the back of the box, and the
gauge would have to be set to the total width of the
hinge. The back edges of the lid and the back edge of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the lower portion of the box are planed away at an
angle of 45 degrees as indicated by the dotted lines.</p>

<p><a href="#f228">Fig. 228</a> shows the same box with the lid open, and it
will be observed that the chamfered edges come together
and form a stop which prevents the lid falling backwards
and breaking the box. This method of letting-in
the knuckle flush is a useful one for box work because
the ordinary stock brass butt hinge can be used.
Attention may, however, be called to the "stopped
butt-hinge," which is specially made to answer the
above purpose; in its action a similar mechanical
principle as the one applied to the box is used.</p>

hinge, used on the top and bottom of wardrobe doors,
more particularly the interior door of a three-winged
wardrobe where the method of fixing is confined to the
cornice and plinth. The flange carrying the pins or
pivot is let into the top and bottom of the door, the
remaining flange being let into the cornice and plinth
respectively.</p>

<p><b>Rising Butt Hinges.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f236">Fig. 236</a> is the rising butt hinge,
used on dining and drawing-room doors, so that when
the door is opened the door rises sufficiently to clear the
thickness of the carpet. This hinge has also an advantage
over the ordinary butt hinge in that it is self-closing,
<i>i.e.</i>, the weight of the door <i>plus</i> the bevel on the
hinge joint causes the door to close. Band and hook
hinges and other ordinary varieties are too well known
to require illustrating.</p>

<p><b>Acute Angle Hingeing</b>.&mdash;<a href="#f237">Fig. 237</a> is a sectional plan
of a corner cupboard showing a good method of hingeing
the door. The inset <i>a</i> shows an enlarged view of the
corner carrying the hinge, also the adaptor piece <i>c</i>,
which is fitted to the inside edge of the cupboard so that
the hinged edges are at 90 degrees to the face. This is
a far better and stronger method than that shown at <i>b</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
which is often attempted with disastrous results. The
incorrect method <i>b</i> allows insufficient wood for fixing
purposes, and in nearly all cases the thin edge of the
door breaks away during the making and fitting, or soon
after completion. The adaptor piece may have a face
mould worked upon it to give a pilaster-like appearance
if fancy so dictates.</p>

<p><b>Inside Hingeing.</b>&mdash;When a door is being hung <i>inside</i>
the carcase (that is, not hinged <i>over</i> the ends) it is permissible,
in the case of light work, to let the whole thickness
of the hinge into the door; and when screwing the
door to the carcase it is usual to fix the knuckle of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
hinge flush with the face of the carcase, thus allowing
the door frame to stand back, making a break of about
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. with the face. The marking gauge should be set
to the full width of the hinge; the mark, gauged on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
inside of the carcase end, thus forms a line to guide the
worker whilst fixing the door. To successfully fix a
door it generally requires two persons, one to hold the
door in position, whilst the other bores the holes and
fixes the screws.</p>

<p><a href="#f238">Fig. 238</a> shows the correct method of fitting butt
hinges on high-class work. One wing of the hinge is let
into the door, and the other wing is let into the carcase
or door jamb, thus distributing a proportion of the
weight to the carcase end instead of allowing the whole
of the weight to be carried by the screws as would be the
case in <i>a</i>, <a href="#f237">Fig. 237</a>. The method of sinking each portion
of the hinge into the door and carcase respectively is
costly; hence it is not the general practice in cheap
work. In <a href="#f239">Fig. 239</a> the top and bottom of carcase
(T and B) are shown set back to allow the door to close.</p>

<p><b>Outside Hingeing.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f240">Fig. 240</a> illustrates the portion
of a door frame and carcase end when the door is hung
on the face of the carcase. The correct method of
letting in the hinge is shown in the enlarged section
(<a href="#f241">Fig. 241</a>), but, as previously mentioned, the hinge may
have its entire thickness let into the door frame where
it is of a light character. The door frame projects
slightly over the carcase end, and occasionally a bead
mould is worked on the edge of the door so as to give
a finish and partly hide the joint. The bead would, of
course, be the same size as the diameter of the knuckle of
the hinge; and the knuckle, therefore, will form a continuation
of the bead and give a workmanshiplike finish.</p>

<p><b>Fall Fronts.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f242">Fig. 242</a> is a sectional view of a fall

and arranged so that the edges form a stop when the
desk front is turned to a horizontal position. The
position for the fitting of the brass plates carrying the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
pivot-pin is somewhat awkward; but, by first sinking
the plates into the carcase ends, and then slotting the
edges of the fall, it will be found that the fall front may
be put in from its horizontal position, and that sufficient
room is left to enable the screwdriver to be
manipulated without inconvenience.</p>

<p><b>Fly Rail.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f243">Fig. 243</a> is a sketch of a small table with
the top removed. A revolving fly rail is shown pivoted
upon a piece of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in. wire. The object of this fly rail is
to form a support to the small hinged drop-leaf of the
table. This method is suitable for small occasional
tables and similar articles.</p>

<p><b>Draught Screens.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f244">Fig. 244</a> illustrates the end elevation
and plan of a draught screen which is constructed
of a light framework and covered with baize or American
cloth. The reversible double-folding hinge (<a href="#f230">Fig.
230</a>) would answer admirably for such a screen. Cases
occur, however, where it is desired to hinge a screen
to be used for an invalid's bedside, and it is then
important that all draught should be excluded through
the jointed edges. The double reversible hinge will
not fulfil these conditions, and the following method is
therefore adopted.</p>

<p>In the plan, Fig. <a href="#f244">244</a>, A and B, two laths of hardwood
(beech, birch or mahogany answer splendidly) are
shown. They are made the same length and the same
width as the edges of the screen, the corners being
slightly rounded away.</p>

<p>A double-folding, draught-proof hinge is then made
as follows: Procure good fine webbing, about 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in.
wide, and the necessary large-headed tacks. Lay the
laths side by side as shown in <a href="#f244">Fig. 244</a>, and proceed to
web them as shown. Commence with the web under
the lath A; bring it between the laths and over B; now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
take it round the left-hand edge of B, and round the
back and between the laths and over A, continuing this
method of wrapping the laths until the lower end is
reached, and then fastening the webbing as indicated
by the dotted lines which represent the tacks. This
self-contained hinge is then fixed to the edges of the
screen by boring suitable holes through the laths and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
using countersunk screws. This is a cheap and efficient
method of overcoming the difficulty. A similar method
is used for the household clothes horse.</p>

<p><b>Finger Joint Hinge.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f245">Fig. 245</a> is a finger joint&mdash;a
movable interlocking joint used to support the leaf of a
Pembroke table. The small portion is screwed to the
table rail and the shaped bracket swings out to support
the drop leaf. The shaded portion of the bracket shows
the timber chamfered away so that the fingers may be
easily put behind the bracket to manipulate it. Note
that the corners are slightly rounded off, as indicated
by the black portion of the sketch, and that the mortises
are cut about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. deeper than the thickness of the
timber used. This joint has now been almost superseded
by a cheap stamped galvanised iron bracket of
exactly the same pattern. The joint, however, is still
used for repair work and in cases where a stamped metal
bracket has not sufficient overhang.</p>

<p><b>Knuckle Joint Hinge.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f246">Fig. 246</a> is a similar type of

This arrangement of hingeing allows the table leg to
swing in an angle of 180 degrees and is much neater in
its appearance. It is often used to connect a movable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
table leg to the framing, where it is necessary for the
table leg and rail to swing outwards and support a drop
leaf. The pivot is formed by a piece of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-in. or <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in.
round iron rod running through the centre of the joint.</p>

<p><b>Open Joint Hingeing.</b>&mdash;The next three illustrations
apply more particularly to the hanging of the ordinary
household door.</p>

<p><a href="#f247">Fig. 247</a> is termed "open joint hanging," from the
fact that when the door is open a certain amount of
open space exists between the edge of the door and the
doorpost. This open space varies according to the
position in which the butt hinge is fixed. A section is
shown at which the pin of the hinge is let in level with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the face of the door. This will allow the door to open
as shown by the dotted line, and it will not clear the
architrave moulding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;"><a name="f249" id="f249"></a>
<img src="images/f249.jpg" width="371" height="181" alt="Fig. 249.&mdash;Close Joint Hingeing." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 249.&mdash;Close Joint Hingeing.</span>
</div>

<p><a href="#f248">Fig. 248</a> indicates the position of the hinge fixed so as
to allow the door to open and lay flat back to the architrave
moulding. In this instance the butts are made
with wider wings, and they are generally provided to
take three screws (see <a href="#f233">Fig. 233</a>, right-hand wing of
hinge).</p>

<p>To determine the position of the centre pin of the
hinge the following rule is observed. The centre of the
pivot pin of the hinge must be <i>half the distance</i> between
the face of the door, when closed, and the outside of the
architrave moulding.</p>

<p><b>Close Joint Hanging.</b>&mdash;The method known as "close
joint hanging" ensures the joint at the hanging stile
being in close proximity to the hanging rail; this is
shown at <a href="#f249">Fig. 249</a>. The first member of the architrave
moulding is generally a bead of the same diameter as the
knuckle of the hinge. The butt hinge is let in as shown
in the illustration, and the door when opened forms a
close-fitting joint.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 250.&mdash;Rule Joint Hinge, with Leaf Open.</span>
</div>

<p><b>The Rule Joint Hinge</b> is used to connect the top and
the drop leaf of a table in cases where continuity of
design is desired, so that the edge of the top and the leaf
will show an ovolo moulding when the table is either
open or closed. To the inexperienced worker it presents
several difficulties and, if it is a first effort, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
advisable to try out a sample joint on a couple of odd
pieces of timber.</p>

<p><a href="#f250">Fig. 250</a> illustrates the joint when the leaf is opened
or in a horizontal position. At <a href="#f252">Fig. 252</a> we have the
joint when the leaf is let down to a vertical position. It
should be observed in the latter figure that the edge A of
the drop leaf is in alignment with the axis of the hinge.
Steel or brass back-flap hinges (<a href="#f233">Fig. 233</a>) are generally
used and they are sunk into the table as suggested.</p>

<p>Set out the work full size as at <a href="#f251">Fig. 251</a>, and mark
point 1, which is to be the position of the joint. Draw
1, 2, at right angles to the table top. Mark point 3 on
the vertical line for the centre of the hinge, and mark
point 4 approximately as shown.</p>

and the moulding is selected on account of its suitability
to hide the joint of the lining piece.</p>

<p><a href="#f255">Fig. 255</a> is of a more intricate type, and is often used
on jewellers' showcases. The end at the right hand is
slightly rebated to receive the frame, and both the rail

<p><a href="#f260">Fig. 260</a> is a rebated joint, broken at the front by a
bead moulding. The illustration shows its application
to a circular-fronted cupboard, and it will be noticed
that the hinged rails are received in a rebate which is
worked on the carcase ends. The rebated joint at the

<p><a href="#f264">Fig. 264</a> is a special type of hook joint as used on

when fitting the slip to a narrow drawer, but this
can always be overcome by putting in the screws from
the top of the bearer instead of from underneath.</p>

<p>Shutting joints which are required to be "light-tight,"
such as those used in photographic work, are
generally formed by slightly grooving the frame and
inserting a strip of black velvet. The friction of the
high pile of the velvet prevents the filtration of light
through the joint.</p>

<p>When making air-tight showcases, one of the best and
simplest tests is to place a lighted candle in the case and
close all the doors; if the candle goes out within three

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>othing definite is known as to the origin of dovetailing,
but a quaint and pleasing little story
which is well worth repeating runs as follows:
A farmer had called in the local "joyner" to do
sundry repairs at the homestead. One day, whilst
enjoying a humble meal, he sat watching some
doves as they hopped about the yard. Struck by the
movement of their wedge-shaped tails, it occurred to
him to joint his timber by the interlocking method;
hence we have <i>dovetails</i>.</p>

<p><b>Through Dovetailing.</b>&mdash;One of the simplest forms of
the dovetail joint is shown in <a href="#f267">Fig. 267</a>, where two pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
of timber are joined by the method known as "through"
dovetailing. This method is used in everyday practice
for joining the corners of frames, bracket trusses, and
a hundred and one other articles.</p>

<p><a href="#f268">Figs. 268</a> and <a href="#f269">269</a> show the method of through dovetailing
as applied to the making of boxes, plinths, and
general carcase work; it is used in positions where no
objection can be taken to the end grain showing on
each side of the finished work. In the case of plinths
and furniture cornices the foundation frame is made of
yellow pine or other cheap wood, and the more expensive
and rare timbers are glued and mitred around in
various thicknesses and shapes, thus saving the more
costly material and strengthening the construction by
the method known as laminating. In many cases all
that is necessary is to veneer the face sides, thus
covering and hiding any unsightliness.</p>

<p><b>Lap-dovetailing.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f270">Fig. 270</a> is an example of lap-dovetailing,
such as is used where a drawer side joins
with the drawer front. It is not permissible to allow
the end grain of the timber to show at the front of a
drawer, and this is why resort is had to the lap-dovetail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
As the most general use of the dovetail is for
this and similar purposes, we shall therefore deal fully
with the methods of marking out and the making of this
class of joint.</p>

<p><b>Angles.</b>&mdash;A most important point in the construction
of a dovetail is to avoid having the angles of the pins
and tails too acute. An inclination of one in eight is
considered correct; no hard and fast rule need be
obeyed, but the variation should on no account be less
than one in six.</p>

<p><a href="#f271">Fig. 271</a> shows a simple method to obtain the correct
angle. Take a piece of timber and plane up the face
edge (A, B) true and straight; mark out a line (C, D)
at right angles to the face edge and space off 8 ins. as
shown; now measure a distance of 1 in. (D, E), and
join E to point eight. This will give the correct angle
for the dovetails, and it may then be transferred to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
joiners' bevel. Many workers who are constantly on
dovetail work make a zinc template to the exact angle
and keep it specially for the purpose (<a href="#f272">Fig. 272</a>).</p>

<p><b>Squaring.</b>&mdash;Another important point to remember
is that the drawer sides must be true and squared
to an exact length and planed up to thickness; otherwise
the finished drawer will be in winding and out of
truth.</p>

<p>To true and square the ends of drawer sides, drawer
backs and drawer front, a most useful little machine is
the mitre trimmer; failing this, excellent results can
be obtained by using the shooting board.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 273.&mdash;&mdash;Method of Marking with Cutting Gauge.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Gauging.</b>&mdash;After squaring up the timber accurate
gauging of the ends is another important point. The
gauge used should be a cutting gauge, so that the line is
incised about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">32</span> in. in depth, thus effectually cutting
the cross fibres of the timber.</p>

<p><a href="#f273">Fig. 273</a> shows the method of using the cutting gauge.
The stock of the gauge must be held well up to the end
of the timber. The gauge is a most difficult tool for the
novice to use, and his trouble is generally caused by
holding it too flat. Tilt the gauge a little so that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
thumbscrew shown in the illustration goes nearer to
the floor; the blade will then not bite so keenly, and
better results will be obtained. The dotted lines indicate
the positions which the dovetails will occupy when
marked out.</p>

<p>The gauge is set a trifle less than the thickness of the
drawer sides to allow for the thickness of the steel
cutter, and a gauge line is marked on the inside of the
front and all round the drawer back. The gauge is now
readjusted so as to leave a <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in. lap on the front, and
a line marked on the ends of the front and all round
the ends of the sides which will engage the drawer
front. A glance at <a href="#f270">Figs. 270</a> and <a href="#f273">273</a> will make this
clear.</p>

<p>The dovetail pins on drawer part and back are spaced

line by the method shown at <a href="#f272">Fig. 272</a>&mdash;that is, by
using the try-square and marking awl.</p>

<p>The drawer front is now put into the bench vice, and
the pins are cut as indicated in <a href="#f274">Fig. 274</a>. The drawer
back is treated in a similar manner, but of course in
this case it is not "lap" but "through" dovetailing,
and the saw kerf goes through the timber and down to
the gauge line.</p>

<p>We now come to the point where it is necessary to
remove the superfluous material. <a href="#f274">Fig. 274</a> shows a
method commonly adopted and known as sawing out
the waste; the saw is held at an angle and part of the
inside portion of the dovetail is cut away as shown.
This is a good plan for the amateur, because it shows
him at the commencement of his chopping out which
will be the pin and which the tail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

bench after it has been sawn, and with a mallet and
sharp chisel the corner of the dovetail is knocked off as
shown. This takes the bulk of the material away and
the dovetail is then pared out square in the usual
way. The illustration (<a href="#f276">Fig. 276</a>) also shows how the
chisel is held for vertical paring (B) and for horizontal
paring (C).</p>

curly timbers, such as tobacco mahogany and satinwood,
it is a laborious process to carefully chop away
the timber in small pieces, and to overcome this difficulty
we occasionally see the workman take a twist-bit
and bore a series of holes as shown. A great portion of
the timber may then be split away by inserting the
chisel end-way into the grain, after which it is pared to
a finish.</p>

it will be of interest to give several illustrations of

<p>The completed drawer back is marked on the sides
in an exactly similar manner.</p>

<p>Another method of marking through dovetails is
shown at <a href="#f279">Fig 279</a>. The side is held in position on the
end, and the dovetail saw is inserted and drawn out of
the saw kerf, thus leaving the exact mark on the
drawer-back.</p>

<p>Other workers prefer a pounce-bag instead of a saw.
A pounce-bag consists of a piece of fairly open woven
muslin filled with a mixture of French chalk and
finely-powdered whiting; the muslin is tied up with a
piece of thin twine like the mouth of a flour sack. All
that is necessary is to place the timber in position and
bang the bag on the top of the saw-cuts, when sufficient
powder will pass through the bag and down the saw
kerf to mark the exact positions of the lines.</p>

<p><b>Sawing the Dovetails.</b>&mdash;After marking out the pins
on the drawer sides, we proceed with the next operation,
that is, sawing the dovetails ready for chopping out the
waste material. The drawer side is taken and firmly
secured in the bench screw and sawn as at <a href="#f281">Fig. 281</a>;
it is most important that the saw kerf is kept <i>inside</i>
the line which has been scratched by the marking awl.
See <a href="#f280">Fig. 280</a>, where the dotted line represents the gauge
line and the outside lines indicate the scores of
the marking awl. Failure to observe this condition
will result in faulty dovetailing, and it will also prove
the necessity for using a finely-toothed and thin-bladed
dovetail saw.</p>

<p>To cut out the waste wood (or core), the usual procedure
is to saw away the half-dovetails as at <a href="#f275">Fig. 275</a>.
With care, this can be accomplished with the dovetail
saw, thus avoiding unnecessary labour and the use of
the paring chisel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>After sawing, the drawer side is placed flat upon the
bench, one end in contact with the bench to prevent the
drawer side from slipping away; a chisel (preferably
bevelled edged) of suitable width is now taken and a
small channel is cut as at A, <a href="#f282">Fig. 282</a>. The method of
cutting this channel is shown in the same illustration.
The chisel-cut is started about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. from the gauge
line; the cut is made right up to the gauge line, which
(when gauging) was made <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">32</span> in. deep so as to cut the
cross fibres of the timber. A small piece of waste wood
will therefore come away as at A.</p>

<p>The object of cutting this small channel is so that,
when the chisel is held vertically on the gauge line and
struck with the mallet, the chisel will have no tendency
to force its way backward and overshoot the gauge line.
The waste or core is now removed by holding the chisel
approximately vertical and applying sufficient power
to drive it half-way through the timber. The drawer
side is now turned over, the operation repeated, and
the core pushed out. Care must be exercised whilst
cutting away the core to ensure the chisel being held
nearly perpendicular; if too much lead (or bevel) be
given, a faulty and undercut dovetail will be the result.
Undercut dovetails prevent a proper grip of the glue;
they give a weak joint, and often cause the face of the
drawer side to be splintered whilst driving up the joint.
If it be necessary to ease one or two shavings from off
the drawer side whilst fitting the completed drawer in
the carcase, the joint will show a greater gap as each
succeeding shaving is removed.</p>

<p>In common work, especially in soft timbers, many
workers allow the pins of a drawer back to run through
the sides about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">16</span> in. and hammer down the pins of the
dovetail. This is called "bishoping the dovetails," and
is unnecessary if the work be properly made and fitted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>An alternative method of dovetailing is that of
cutting the dovetails first, as shown at <a href="#f283">Fig. 283</a>. Four
or six drawer sides are placed in the vice and the dovetails
are sawn at one operation. A little lead (or bevel)
from front to back is given whilst sawing, and if this
method be used care must be taken to see that the parts
of the drawer sides which will be on the inside of the

<p>After sawing the dovetails in this manner the sides
are placed in their respective positions on the drawer
fronts or backs, and marked with a pounce-bag or by
using the saw-blade method. The pins are then cut in
the usual way, care being taken that the saw kerf be on
the outside of the marks, otherwise the pins will finish
too slack to engage with the tails.</p>

<p><b>Frame Dovetails.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f284">Fig. 284</a> is a sketch of a constructional
frame such as is used for building up a
cornice or plinth. At the joint marked A an edge
barefaced dovetail is shown. From the separated
sketches of the joint (B) it will be seen that the dovetail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
can be put together either from the top or the
bottom of the framing as all its edges are parallel;
glue is relied upon to hold it in position. The centre
stretcher rail at <a href="#f284">Fig. 284</a> is similar, except that in
this case it is a complete dovetail in place of a barefaced
one.</p>

<p>Some workers, when making either of the above
joints, prefer to give a slight bevel to the dovetail, so
that it drives tightly into the housing when put
together.</p>

<p>A variation of this type of dovetail is frequently used
to joint internal uprights to the horizontal shelves of
writing desks, cabinets, and bookcases, etc. The dovetailed
portion is parallel for about three-fourths of its
width; the remaining part is tapered towards the front
edge and notched away at the face so as to conceal the
method of construction. An illustration of the top
portion of a division 14 ins. wide is shown at <a href="#f284">Fig.
284, C</a>. The other portion is of course dovetailed to
fit it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Blind Lap-Dovetailing.</b>&mdash;At <a href="#f285">Fig. 285</a> is shown a
type of blind lap-dovetailing. This makes a good,
sound joint, but it has the disadvantage of showing a
small portion of the timber of the front rail end-way of
the grain. Joints of this kind are used for cornices,
boxes, etc., and also for painted furniture.</p>

<p><b>Housed and Mitred Dovetail.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f286">Fig. 286</a> is another
form of dovetail&mdash;commonly called a housed and
mitred or rebated and mitred dovetail. In this instance
we see that a small portion is mitred at top and
bottom edges, and when used in plinth or cornice work,
or for making tea-caddies, etc., the edges are (when
completing the work) covered either with the moulding,
which is planted on the cornice or plinth, or with the
top and bottom of the box or tea-caddy.</p>

<p>The method of making a housed and mitred dovetail
joint is seen in <a href="#f286">Fig. 286</a>. The ends to be joined are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
planed up true and square and then rebated as shown.
The dotted lines indicate the portion which has been
worked away. The dovetails are now sawn and pared
out in the usual way and the part denoted by the arrow
is afterwards cut away with a chisel and finally finished
to a smooth surface with a rebate plane; the method
of working is shown at <a href="#f287">Fig. 287</a>, where the dovetail
pins are seen with the waste portions cut away.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#f287">Fig. 287</a> also shows the method of cutting away the
mitred part. A temporary piece of wood is planed to a
true mitre and placed underneath the dovetailed piece
to form a template. Both pieces of the timber are
now secured to the bench with a handscrew or cramp;
the template A will form a guide for the chisel and
rebate plane and allow a sharp edge or arris to be
worked on the mitre.</p>

<p><b>Setting out the Joint.</b>&mdash;For constructing a dovetail
joint at the corner of a frame, as <a href="#f300">Fig. 300</a>, it is necessary
at the outset to trim up the ends of the timber square
and true. This may be accomplished by neatly sawing
to the line and paring the end of the wood with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
a sharp chisel, or by bringing the wood to a finish with
a finely-set plane, such as an iron-faced smoothing
plane. The ends of the wood must be perfectly square
when tested from either the face side or from the
marked edge.</p>

<p><b>Drawers.</b>&mdash;When dovetailing drawers or boxes it is
necessary to square up the ends of all the stock and
gauge them, as shown at <a href="#f273">Fig. 273</a>. This illustration
shows how to gauge the lines on a drawer side; the
dovetailed joint in this case, however, does not run
through the drawer front and leave the work unsightly,
as the joint at <a href="#f300">Fig. 300</a> would do. The method used is
shown at <a href="#f309">Fig. 309</a>, and it is commonly known as lap-dovetailing.
Most workers cut the dovetail pins on the
drawer fronts and the drawer backs first, after which
they mark the drawer sides with the marking awl.
The dovetailing of the drawer back is shown at <a href="#f310">Fig. 310</a>.
This is the type known as "through dovetailing," the
method being similar in regard to tool operations as the
single joint shown at <a href="#f300">Fig. 300</a>.</p>

<p>When the pins on the drawer front have been sawn,
the waste material is cut away, as at <a href="#f311">Fig. 311</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
First stab down with the vertical chisel, which must
make the cut about <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">32</span> in. in front of the gauge line
(<a href="#f311">see illustration</a>). This commencing of the cut slightly
in front of the gauge line is a very important feature.
The chisel may be likened to a wedge, and if the chisel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
edge be placed exactly upon the gauge line and force
be applied to the handle, it will force the timber away
equally on each side of the gauge line, and the finished
depth of the hole will therefore be too deep for the
thickness of the drawer side; in other words, it will
press itself over the gauge line on both sides.</p>

<p>By taking the first vertical cut on the waste side of
the gauge line, and then removing a small piece with
the chisel held obliquely, as at <a href="#f311">Fig. 311</a>, the wood is
removed and less resistance is offered to the chisel when
the next vertical cut is made. This overshooting the
gauge line is a common fault with the beginner, who is
puzzled at the result because he is certain he had his
chisel exactly on the gauge line when he commenced his
vertical cut. It is especially noticeable in soft-grained
woods.</p>

<p>To cut away the waste of a lap-dovetail (<a href="#f311">Fig. 311</a>),
the vertical and oblique cuts are repeated until the
final trimming up is required, and now is the time to
finish both the vertical and the horizontal cuts exactly
on the gauge lines.</p>

<p>Some workers prefer to cut the drawer sides first, and
if this method is preferred (and it has its advantages
for cheap work) several drawer sides are cut at once by
placing four or six behind one another in the vice and
sawing them all at one operation.</p>

<p>The drawer front is placed in the vice, and the drawer
side held upon it, whilst the saw blade is placed in the
saw kerf and drawn smartly forward. This will give
the required marks at the exact position desired. It
must be remembered, however, to saw just inside these
dovetail-pin lines, otherwise the finished joint will
be too slack, owing to the removal of the sawdust,
which is practically equal to the thickness of the saw
blade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Machine-made Dovetails.</b>&mdash;As a general rule
machine-made drawer and box dovetails show both the
pins and the tails of exactly the same size. The reason
is obvious after an inspection of <a href="#f314">Fig. 314</a>, which shows
the position in which the pieces are held during the
machining operations. In spite of a certain amount of
prejudice they are satisfactory and thoroughly reliable
and have their place in modern shop and office fittings.</p>

chisel prior to the sawing operation. The sawing of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the bevelled side is worked in a similar manner; but
occasionally we find amateurs who adopt the method
shown at <a href="#f318">Fig. 318</a>. A block of wood (H) is first made
by boring a 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in. hole through its entire length, and
afterwards making a saw cut at the desired bevel.
The object of this block, which is kept specially for the
purpose, is to form a guide for those who have not full
control of the dovetail saw; the back of the saw clears
the hole, and the required bevel is obtained. When a
saw cut has been made at each side of the groove, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
surplus timber is pared away in the following manner:
Cut away portion E, <a href="#f319">Fig. 319</a>; then cut away portion
F, and lastly cut away the apex portion marked G.
Continue by this method of paring until the approximate
depth is reached. To ensure a correct depth
throughout the entire groove, the router plane (or, as
it is often called, "the old woman's tooth plane,"
<a href="#f317">Fig. 317</a>) is used.</p>

<p><b>Mitreing.</b>&mdash;The term mitreing is generally used to
denote the type of joint used at the corner of a picture
frame; or where two pieces of wood are bevelled
away so as to fit each other, as the skirting or plinth
mould at <a href="#f321">Fig. 321</a>. In these cases the timber is cut so
that the joint is at 45 degrees to the face, and the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
pieces, when placed together, form an angle of 90
degrees (a right angle).</p>

<p>The term mitreing, however, is not confined to the
fitting of timber around a right angle; it may be justly
applied to the fitting of a moulding around an angle
irrespective of the number of its degrees.</p>

<p>One often hears such terms as "a half mitre," used
to denote the fitting of a moulding around an octagonal
column or pedestal, and probably it would be more
correct to describe the joint as a mitre cut at 22<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>
degrees. Mitreing consists of halving the angle and
making each piece to fit the line of bisection. Should
the angle be bounded by straight lines, as at <a href="#f321">Fig. 321</a>,
then the mitred joint will be a straight line, but should
the angle be bounded by a curved and a straight line,
as at <a href="#f322">Fig. 322</a>, A, or by two curved lines, then the
mitred joint will have to be a curved line if the mouldings
are to be of the same section.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;"><a name="f324" id="f324"></a>
<img src="images/f324.jpg" width="359" height="178" alt="Fig. 324.&mdash;Sawing Block for Mitreing." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 324.&mdash;Sawing Block for Mitreing.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Finding the Angle.</b>&mdash;For straight mitres, the mitre
joint line is found by bisecting the angle, as shown in
the various examples, and the following instructions
are given to enable the reader to follow the diagram
(<a href="#f323">Fig. 323</a>). Take a pair of compasses, or dividers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and with any convenient opening strike out the arc
A, B. Put the point of the compasses on A, and mark
another arc C; then, without altering the distance
between the points of the compass, put the point on B,
and mark the arc D. Draw the line E from the corner,
so that it cuts through the intersection made by the
arcs C and D. The angle A B is now halved by the
line E, and this method may be applied to any angle.</p>

<p><b>Sawing Block.</b>&mdash;For sawing mouldings, etc., to their
approximate shape, a home-made sawing block is
generally used, as shown at <a href="#f324">Fig. 324</a>. Two pieces of
wood are glued one on the top of the other, the required
angle is transferred thereto, and the saw kerf made.
In the sketch the saw kerfs are shown at 45 degrees,
right and left, and other angles and kerfs may be made
where desired.</p>

<p><b>Planing.</b>&mdash;After sawing the piece to approximately
the correct angle, it is necessary on high-class work to
plane the cut end so as to give a perfect finish and
enable a glued joint to be made. This may be accomplished
by using the plane on the shooting board, as
shown at <a href="#f325">Fig. 325</a>, and, if the worker is constantly
using mitres of various angles, it is an easy matter to
make new angle blocks and fix them on to the board.
Other workers prefer the screw mitre trap shown at
<a href="#f326">Fig. 326</a>. This apparatus takes wide plinth or cornice
moulds, and the angle may be altered by fitting
temporary packing pieces under the work so as to tilt
the moulding to the desired angle. The method of
using the plane is indicated in the illustration.</p>

<p>Another method in everyday use by those workers
who are constantly mitreing wide pieces of stock at
45 degrees is the "donkey's ear" shooting board illustrated
at <a href="#f327">Fig. 327</a>. The plane is laid on its side on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
surface of the board marked A, and used in a similar
manner to that shown at <a href="#f325">Fig. 325</a>.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 326.&mdash;The Screw Mitre Trap.</span>
</div>

<p>A simple method and one that should always be
remembered because it is handy when working without
a shooting board is shown at <a href="#f328">Fig. 328</a>. Set the marking
or cutting gauge to the thickness of the wood to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
mitred at 45 degrees; then gauge this distance on the
wood, as shown at B; draw from the line to the edge,
as shown, and saw and plane to a finish. The diagonals
of a square give 45 degrees, and this is the method used
to mark out the work. The end of the wood must, of
course, be square with its edges before marking out in
this manner.</p>

<p><a href="#f330">Fig. 330</a> shows a similar framing, but with a wide
moulding M mitred around it. To obtain a correct
intersection of this moulding, the angles A and B are
bisected. The bisection of the angles meets before the
width of the moulding is cleared, therefore the angle C
will again have to be bisected, and the finished joint
will appear as shown. One of the simplest of mouldings
with a large flat face has been chosen to illustrate this.
The moulding could be all in one width, as shown, or it
could be built into the framing in separate pieces, the
wide flat and the piece carrying the mould.</p>

<p><b>Curved Mitres.</b>&mdash;We now come to what are probably
the most difficult of all mitres, viz., curved mitres, and
the writer well remembers in his apprenticeship days
his first experience of attempting to fit the mouldings
around the door shown at <a href="#f331">Fig. 331</a> by using straight
mitres at A. This, of course, is impossible if the
mouldings are of the same section and it is desired to
make all the members correctly intersect. If straight
mitres are used the section of the curved moulding will
have to be of a different shape from the section of the
straight moulding, and in these days of machine-made
mouldings this method is seldom resorted to. It is
better, cheaper, and easier to make curved mitres when
the necessary machinery is at hand.</p>

<p><b>To Set out a Curved Mitre</b> (see <a href="#f332">Fig. 332</a>).&mdash;Draw
a section of the moulding full size, A, as shown at the
left hand of the illustration, and project lines round
the framing, as shown V, W, X, Y and Z. Where the
lines V, W, X, Y and Z intersect at the corner D, it
clearly shows that a straight mitre will not cut all the
points of intersection. A curved line will cut all the
intersections, and a template made of cardboard, sheet
zinc, or veneer, should be made to this shape. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
left-hand side the geometrical setting out is shown for
obtaining the curve without having to resort to drawing
it freehand.</p>

<p>Take half the width of the moulding, as shown by
dotted line A, and where it cuts the approximation of
the curved mitre place the point of the compasses and
strike out a circle as shown; with the same radius
place the compass point on B&mdash;that is, the inside point
of the mitre, and cut the circle on the right and left
with the small arcs shown at <i>aa</i>. With the same radius
put the compass point at the junction of the circle
and mitre line, C V, and cut the circle at right and left,
viz., <i>ee</i>.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 333.&mdash;Template for Mitreing.</span>

<p>Now rule a line through <i>aa</i>, and another line through
<i>ee</i>, and where these lines cut each other it will give the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
correct radius of the curved mitre. The advantage of
knowing the correct radius of a curved mitre is of great
benefit to the skilled machinist, as it enables him to set
up his machine so as to give a definite result.</p>

<p><b>Mitreing a Moulded Door Frame.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f333">Fig. 333</a> illustrates
the method of mitreing the moulded portion of
a door frame where the joint is dowelled, not tenoned.
A small wooden template is made out of beech or other
hardwood, having its ends cut at 45 degrees. This
template is placed on the rail, as shown, and held in
position by placing both the rail and the template in
the vice. The face of the template forms a guide for a
wide chisel, and enables the worker to gradually pare
away the moulding to the correct angle.</p>

<p>When extra length is required, semicircular or circular
work is built up out of four or five thicknesses of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
wood, and the method is called laminating. The
method of building up the semicircular head of a door
frame by this method is shown at <a href="#f339">Figs. 339 and 340</a>.</p>

<p>The shaped framing for kidney-shaped writing tables
and similar classes of work is built up by laminating
pieces of <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in. or 1-in. wood, after which the face side is
veneered so as to hide the glued joints. <a href="#f341">Fig. 341</a> shows
a sketch of one quarter of an elliptical table frame
levelled up and ready for applying the veneer.</p>

<p><b>Lamination.</b>&mdash;If we apply to the dictionary for the
word "lamination," we find that lamellar structure is
the arrangements in thin plates or layers one over the
other, usually having the end joints alternating, and
it is a condition which allows of cleavage in one direction
only. This method is used for nearly all descriptions
of free or irregular curves, such as sweeps, bends,
ogee shapes, and segments of circles. The timber is
marked out in suitable lengths, rough-sawn and then
planed true on the face, glued together, and when set
the sides are cleaned up to the required shape. It is
one of the strongest methods of construction, and
necessarily costly. Pulleys, pulley rims, and a hundred
and one other jobs are built by this method.</p>

<p><a href="#f342">Fig. 342</a> shows one half of a core box built by this

such as garages, garden sheds, toolhouses, etc.,
"weatherboarding" is often preferred to ordinary
matchboarding, chiefly because of the
facility with which it throws off the rain. The
boarding can be bought ready prepared. Three
methods of jointing are shown in the sections at

the most satisfactory types, its boards being planed
and moulded as shown. The other two examples are

<p>Ladder sides are made in two distinct ways. One
method is known as "a plank side," the side being cut
from a plank as shown at the section D; the other
method is called "a pole side," and is constructed by
cutting a straight larch pole in half and using half of the
pole for each side of the ladder, as at section C.</p>

<p><b>Hinged Cornice Poles.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f345">Fig. 345</a> shows a hinged
joint for cornice poles and should be of interest to those
who are frequently removing from house to house.
The joint will adapt itself to fit any bay window (even
a square bay) and it is formed by turning and cutting
the two pieces shown. To fix a cornice pole to a bay
window one of these joints is required for each angle
of the bay, the pole being cut into suitable lengths and
fixed to the hinged joints by the use of the dowel screw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and a little hot glue. It is perhaps needless to remark
that the diameter of the joint should be of the same
diameter as the cornice pole, to enable the rings to easily
slide over the surface.</p>

<p>For fastening a turned ornament (or "finial") to
the end of a cornice pole a double pointed screw
(known in the trade as a "dowel screw") is used, one
half of which is screwed into each part of the pieces to
be joined.</p>

<p><b>Veneer Keying.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f346">Fig. 346</a> illustrates the method of
strengthening the corners of boxes which are made of
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in. or <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-in. timber, by securing the corners with
veneer keys. The box is mitred and glued in the usual
manner, and after allowing sufficient time for the glue
to set, saw kerfs are made as shown at <i>a a</i>. A piece of
thin saw-cut veneer is afterwards glued into the saw
kerfs, and when dry the face is levelled off flush. This
method is often used previous to veneering the face
side of the box with rare veneers, and it is also useful
for repair work. Note that the saw cuts are made at
an angle. Small picture frames are sometimes keyed
instead of nailed.</p>

<p><b>Muntin and Skirting Joint.</b>&mdash;In the case of panelled
rooms it is usually necessary to scribe the muntins (or
uprights) to the skirting. The method is shown in
<a href="#f347">Fig. 347</a>. The bead moulding of the skirting is only
partly removed, as indicated, leaving a solid portion to
which the muntin is skew-nailed.</p>

<p><b>Cot Joint.</b>&mdash;At <a href="#f348">Fig. 348</a> is shown an interesting joint
used largely in the making of Indian cots. The illustrations
indicate how the cross bar and end bar are
mortised into the leg. A turned hardwood peg fits into
a suitably provided hole and locks the tenons, which are
dry jointed (not glued) in position. The head of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
peg forms an ornament (A) at the top of the leg and
should fit tightly in position. At B are seen the end
and cross bars in their relative positions when apart
from the leg. C shows the end bar and cross bar when
the cot is fixed, but in this illustration the leg is purposely
left out of the drawing for a clear representation.
D shows the joints of the leg portion when the part of
the leg above the line at A is sawn off. The hardwood
peg is shown at E.</p>

<p><b>Sideboard Pillars, etc.</b> (<a href="#f349">Fig. 349</a>).&mdash;For economy,
sideboard pillars are sometimes built up as indicated,
the "shaft," the "base," and the "swell" being made
up of three distinct pieces. Turned pins are left on the
shaft and the base, and these are secured at the joint
by the use of a double-pointed screw called a dowel
screw. This does away with the necessity of reducing
the squares at the top of the wood and thus getting the

<span class="caption">Fig. 358.&mdash;Patera Covers to Hide Screws.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Patera Covers.</b>&mdash;In cases where the style of ornament
permits of it, patera covers are used instead of
pelleting. <a href="#f358">Fig. 358</a> shows the jointing of shaped spandrails,
etc., to carcase ends of light portable cabinet work,
etc. A hole is bored about <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. deep into the end,
and a screw is used to hold the shaping in position.
After fixing the rail a small turned button, called a
turned patera, is inserted in the hole, thus giving an
ornamental finish, as shown in the front view. The
turned patera is driven fairly tightly into the hole, but
not glued. When it is required to take the article
apart a chisel is carefully inserted under the edge of the
patera to remove it, and the screw can then be taken
out. This method is often used for the construction of
light hanging bookcases and similar objects. For a
bookcase having an end 8 ins. wide three of these turned
buttons and three screws would be used to secure the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
shelf to the end. Pateras in different styles may be
purchased from any dealer in woodworking sundries.</p>

<p><b>Buttoning.</b>&mdash;The tops of tables, sideboards, etc.,
should not be fixed with screws in the ordinary way.
At the front, screws can be driven upwards through the
top rail, but at the sides and back, buttons should be
employed, as in <a href="#f359">Fig. 359</a>, so that the top is free to
shrink. It is otherwise liable to split if immovably
fixed. The tops of kitchen tables are usually fixed in
this way, to allow for shrinkage.</p>

<p><b>Frames for Oil Paintings.</b>&mdash;The method of making
joints for frames on which the canvas is stretched for
oil paintings is shown at <a href="#f360">Fig. 360</a>. They are generally
mitred at the corners and fitted with loose wedges. The
four parts of the frame can be held temporarily by a
piece of thin board while the canvas is being tacked to
the edges of the frame. In the accompanying illustrations
<a href="#f360">Fig. 360</a> shows the action of the wedges when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
tightening up the frame, the result being to open the
mitre joint. <a href="#f361">Fig. 361</a> shows the position of the saw
cuts for receiving the hardwood wedges. Note that
the parallel groove is carried the full length of the
material for greater convenience in cutting. The other
groove is taken from the outer angle of the mitre joint
inwards. The cut finishes with due regard to the
necessary taper; see the dotted lines showing taper in
<a href="#f360">Fig. 360</a>. The grooves will be wide enough after being
cut with an ordinary hand-rip saw, but for large work
they are usually grooved on the circular saw bench.</p>

<p><b>Slot Screwing, or Keyhole Screwing,</b> is a most
useful way of joining light woodwork in such a manner
that the fixing method is not exposed to the eye. A
stout screw is inserted to within <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. of the head, as at
<a href="#f365">Fig. 365</a>. In the adjoining piece a hole is bored with a
centre bit and a slot is cut with an <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. chisel. The
two pieces of timber are placed together, and by sliding
the upper piece forward the screw runs up into the slot
or keyhole and secures the joint. <a href="#f366">Fig. 366</a> shows the
application of the joint fixing a shaped bracket to the
shaped shelf; the bracket and shelf are inverted in the
illustration to clearly show the method of jointing. For
heavy work special brass plates are obtainable for this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
purpose; one plate is let flush into the upper piece and
the other plate into the lower piece.</p>

<p>Battening (<a href="#f367">Fig. 367</a>).&mdash;A good method of joining
cross battens to drawing boards and other wide surfaces
is shown here. After boring for the screws, slots
are cut so as to allow the screws to move along the slots
when shrinkage takes place. In <a href="#f368">Fig. 368</a> a similar
method is applied to secure the drawer bottom to the
drawer back. If shrinkage takes place in the drawer
bottom and it leaves the groove in the drawer front, the
screws are slackened, the drawer bottom is knocked up
into the groove, and the screws again inserted. For
drawing boards, etc., specially made elliptical-shaped
slotted brass socket cups are made to receive the screw
heads.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>uzzle Joints are not only interesting in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
themselves, but are often excellent studies in
craftsmanship. The majority of them, if to be
satisfactory as puzzles, call for very careful
setting out and cutting, entailing the same degree
of skill that is demanded for high-class cabinet
work. For this reason several examples may well find
a place in a volume dealing with woodwork joints. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
a rule, these puzzles should be made in hardwood, such
as dark walnut or beech, as in whitewood the joints are
soon liable to wear.</p>

<p><b>Chinese Puzzle.</b>&mdash;The ingenious puzzle of the Chinese
type shown in <a href="#f369">Fig. 369</a> is probably older than many of
us could guess, but as it is one that can be made by any
woodworker we give full directions as to how it may be
constructed. The complete article may be called, in
form, a six-pointed pyramid. It is made up of twenty-one
different pieces, each cut from wood <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. wide and
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. thick; <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. wood may be used if preferred. For
the purpose either sycamore or white maple is the
most useful.</p>

<p>The pieces required are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><a href="#f370">Fig. 370</a>.&mdash;Six pieces, 3<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> ins. long, with a half slot cut
in the centre as shown. This slot must be exactly the
width of the wood's thickness, and cut exactly half
way through, so that, if two pieces are placed across by
means of the halved joint, their surfaces will be flush.
The slot must also be exactly in the centre.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#f371">Fig. 371</a>.&mdash;Six pieces, size 2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> ins. long, with a half-cut
centre slot similar to that of <a href="#f370">Fig. 370</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#f372">Fig. 372</a>.&mdash;Six required, these being 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> ins. in length,
and with slots in the middle as before.</p>

<p><a href="#f373">Fig. 373</a>.&mdash;One of these last six requires special
treatment, as it forms the key block of the puzzle.
After its slot has been cut, one half of the narrow part
must be sawn away, as shown in <a href="#f373">Fig. 373</a>. The inner
edge must also be gently rounded. The special use of
this vital piece, which we will call the "key," will be
fully explained presently.</p>

<p><a href="#f374">Fig. 374</a>.&mdash;Then, in addition to these, there are three
central bars to make. Like the other parts they are
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. by <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in., but are each 4<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> ins. long, and are cut as
shown in <a href="#f374">Fig. 374</a>. The end projections <i>a</i> are <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in.
long, and the cut-away part is exactly half the depth
of the wood. Two of the three pieces (X and Y in
<a href="#f374">Fig. 374</a>) are similar, but the slot <i>b</i> of the third one (Z) is
only <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. wide instead of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. As will be noticed, this
<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span>-in. slot is <i>not</i> in the centre, but corresponds with the
right-hand half of the larger slots of X and Y.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 374.&mdash;The Central Bars.</span>
</div>

<p>In making these twenty-one pieces, what should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
borne in mind is that the different parts fit closely into
each other. Consequently the slots, in width, must be
cut so as to grip the thickness of the wood; in depth
they must be exactly half this thickness.</p>

<p><b>Fitting the Puzzle.</b>&mdash;The three central bars must
first be joined, as those form the skeleton framework of
the structure. <a href="#f375">Fig. 375</a> shows them in position, but as
it is a puzzle in itself as to how they can be got thus
some explanation is necessary.</p>

</table>

<p><b>First Stage.</b>&mdash;First take the bars X and Y (see
<a href="#f374">Fig. 374</a>) and arrange them as shown in <a href="#f376">Fig. 376</a>. It is
most important that the projections <i>a</i> of X face upwards,
and that the projections <i>a</i> of Y face towards
the centre. Then take the bar Z and bring it flat into
the slot of X. The little slot of Z, however, must
remain <i>above</i> the slot of X. Then slide the bar Y
along to the centre, so that the part lettered <i>c</i> slips into
the little slot of bar Z.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>This may seem confusing to read, but it is easy to
follow when the pieces are in one's hand. The result
of this rather clever arrangement is that the six arms
of <a href="#f375">Fig. 375</a> are all exactly the same length, width, and
thickness. They are also arranged so that in each arm
may be clasped one piece each of <a href="#f370">Figs. 370, 371, and
372</a>. The three central arms may, of course, be set up in
a different order, and here we have merely chosen the
way that is the most simple to describe and illustrate.</p>

</table>

<p><b>Second Stage.</b>&mdash;In the remaining part of the work
the chief difficulty is to keep the puzzle from falling to
pieces before the key finally locks it. Take the longer
cross parts, <a href="#f370">Fig. 370</a>, and clasp one to each arm. The
six need not all be put on meanwhile, but only those
which are most easily handled. The next size (<a href="#f371">Fig. 371</a>)
may then be put on.</p>

<p>In the ordinary course each arm could be completed
with its three cross pieces till the sixth was attempted,
and here the reader would find that, at the last moment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
his attempt was frustrated. He could not get the last
small piece in, as other bars lock the puzzle. Here it is
that the "key" comes in.</p>

<p><b>The Key Piece.</b>&mdash;When the writer fits up the puzzle
he finds that three of the arms may straight away be
fitted complete with their three cross parts. These are
the ones where the longer cross piece (<a href="#f370">Fig. 370</a>) <i>lies
flush with the back of the central bar</i> (see <a href="#f377">Fig. 377</a>). This
is easily found out when at work on the puzzle. In
the case of the other three arms there is, of course, a
gap caused by the long slots of the central bars. Adjust
the parts on the first-named three arms, and then deal
with the fourth arm, putting in all three cross parts.
For the little one here, use the "key."</p>

<p>By placing the "key" so that it <i>overlaps the end
projection</i> of the arm (see <a href="#f378">Fig. 378</a>) a space is left at the
centre, and means is thus afforded for getting in the
three cross parts on the remaining two arms.</p>

<p>This practically ends the puzzle. While the "key"
is in its overlapping position the parts may be separated,
but if it is <i>turned round on its narrow neck</i>, so
that it is in exactly the same position as the other five
small cross parts, it locks the whole thing so tightly
that nothing but sheer force could loosen the twenty-one
pieces.</p>

<p>So far as the order of putting together is concerned,
there are many equally satisfactory ways, these being
determined by the ease or difficulty that one experiences
in holding the half-finished puzzle. It all comes to the
same in the end, and the "key" must be placed on one
bar before the last three arms can be completed. The
"key," moreover, must be on one of the bars where a
gap is left at the centre, and not on one where <a href="#f370">Fig. 370</a>
lies flush against the central arm as in <a href="#f377">Fig. 377</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Undoing the Puzzle.</b>&mdash;To take the puzzle to pieces
all that is required is to turn the "key" half round and
push the other two cross bars on that arm towards the
outer point. The cross bars below may then be removed,
and the whole structure falls to pieces.</p>

<p><b>The double dovetail puzzle</b> (<a href="#f379">Fig. 379</a>) consists of
two pieces of wood (usually one dark and the other
light) which, upon examination, appear to be dovetailed
together from each face. This interlocking arrangement
is obviously impossible, and the solution of the puzzle
is only apparent on examining <a href="#f380">Fig. 380</a>, where it will
be seen that the joint fits together diagonally.</p>

<p>At <a href="#f381">Fig. 381</a> are given the diagrams for setting out.
Draw the outline of the elevation, plan and end view.
The end view in the first instance is indicated by
3, 4, 5 and 6, and it measures 1<span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> ins. square. A 1<span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-ins.
square is simply used because 2-ins. wood generally
finishes this size after it is planed up. Set out a square
(A, B, C, D) which stands corner-ways in the larger
square (3, 4, 5, 6). Project the lines D A and C B upwards
as at 1, and on to this drawing (1), set out the
dovetail according to your own idea of length, width
and bevel. Project the four points of your dovetail
downwards into the end view, and where these lines
cut A, B, and D, C draw them downwards and rebate
them into your original plan. This will give the true
shape of the two dovetails and it is to this shape that
you will cut your joint.</p>

<p>The joint is in due course glued up, and next day
you will plane and waste off the four corners of your
model. The end view shows one corner shaded D, 3, A;
this and the other three corners are wasted away. The
result is that the dovetails are thrown into a plane
different from that in which they were made, showing
as <a href="#f379">Fig. 379</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Dovetail Puzzle</b> joint illustrated at <a href="#f382">Fig. 382</a>
has perhaps caused more argument and controversy
amongst woodworkers than any wooden joint. It may
be neatly made in maple, walnut, or mahogany, and
afterwards glued up. The question everyone asks is:
How was it put together?</p>

<p>Take two pieces of wood such as mahogany, walnut
or birch, about 6 ins. long by 1<span class="above">7</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> ins. wide and 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> ins.
thick. Truly plane them up and then set out and make
the tenon and dovetailed piece (<a href="#f383">Fig. 383</a>). Next mark
out and cut the cross bar to fit its corresponding piece.
The joint will go together in a somewhat diagonal
direction as it is pushed into position from the back;
when closed it will appear as at <a href="#f382">Fig. 382</a>. For guidance,
a plan, part elevation and back elevation are added.</p>

<p>An improvement after you have gained experience in
the making of this joint is to make a similar joint,
leaving the face (B, <a href="#f386">Fig. 386</a>) blind; it then does not
show the bevelling of the dovetail at the end C. In
other words, keep the line C, say, <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> in. back from the
face of B. The joint should be glued up and it will then
appear to the average worker that it is an impossible
proposition. (See <a href="#f401">Fig. 401</a>, page 208.)</p>

<p>A further variation of the puzzle is seen in <a href="#f387">Fig. 387</a>.
Here the joint is much simpler, and can easily be
followed from the illustration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Cross Puzzle.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f388">Fig. 388</a> illustrates a six-piece puzzle
joint, similar in some respects to <a href="#f369">Fig. 369</a>, but very
much simpler. Both a back and front view of the
piece D is shown for clearness of illustration. The
method of assembling the pieces is as follows: Hold
piece B upright, and fit piece D across; at the same
time note that the small <i>x</i> marks are opposite each
other. Take piece E and, holding it as shown, slide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
it up the piece B (see arrow) until E engages D
and the small <i>o</i> marks are opposite each other. Piece
C is now fitted behind D, and then piece F will slide in
position and push downwards. The key-piece A is now
put in position, and the puzzle is completed.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Mortising Puzzle.</b>&mdash;The ordinary mortising exercise
is, after the first two or three attempts, generally voted
as uninteresting, but, although the simple puzzle
shown in <a href="#f389">Fig. 389</a> is practically an exercise in mortising,
yet, forming as it does a puzzle, it becomes a fascinating
piece of work.</p>

<p>The puzzle is composed of three pieces of wood, each
4 ins. long, 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> ins. wide, and <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. thick. In each piece
a mortise 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> ins. by <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. should be cut as shown at 1,
<a href="#f390">Fig. 390</a>. In one piece, marked 2, a groove is cut on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
one side, <span class="above">3</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. wide, and in another piece (3) a similar
slot, but <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. wide, is cut, and this is continued on the
other side of the groove to a depth of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. The three
pieces should be set out on a 13-ins. by 1<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-ins. by <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span>-in.
length of wood, as shown at <a href="#f391">Fig. 391</a>, and when ready
sawn apart.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 391.&mdash;How to Cut the Parts.</span>
</div>

<p>The puzzle is put together as shown at <a href="#f389">Fig. 389</a>. In
the first place, hold No. 1 piece upright as shown at A,
then take No. 2 piece with slot uppermost and push it
through the opening in No. 1 piece until the nearest side
of the slot projects <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span> in. as indicated at B. Next place
No. 3 piece on with the slot at the back as shown at C,
and push it down until it touches the bottom of the
opening in No. 2 piece as illustrated at D. The only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
thing to do now is to push No. 2 piece as far as it will
go to make the figure as shown at E.</p>

<p>In this puzzle the parts should fit together fairly
tight, but should not be too stiff.</p>

<p><b>Chinese Cross.</b>&mdash;<a href="#f392">Fig. 392</a> shows a variation of the
Chinese cross, which is perhaps the most fascinating of
all woodwork puzzles. Take six pieces of hardwood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
(<a href="#f394">Fig. 394</a>) and accurately plane and saw them so that
each piece will measure 4 ins. by 1 in. by 1 in. Bearing in
mind that all the cuts are multiples of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in., set out,
saw and chisel five of the pieces to agree with the
sketches 1, 1A, 2, 2A and 3. Leave the key piece intact.
The puzzle is of course to fit all the six pieces together
so as to form the Chinese cross or block given at
<a href="#f392">Fig. 392</a>. As a clue to the method of assembly we give
another sketch (<a href="#f393">Fig. 393</a>) showing four of the pieces
fixed together. The reader can, if he so desires, make
the puzzle to a smaller scale by using six pieces of wood
each measuring 2 ins. long by <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. by <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in.</p>

<p><b>Diagonal Chinese Cross.</b>&mdash;At <a href="#f395">Fig. 395</a> is given a
sketch of a completed Chinese block or cross puzzle in
which the various pieces of wood go together diagonally.
Plane up a piece of hardwood (which may be
about 14 ins. or 15 ins. long) so that it measures on its
end <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. square. Cut the wood into six pieces which
measure about 2<span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">4</span> ins. long, and then proceed to mark
out, saw and pare up with the chisel two pieces like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
sketch A, three pieces like B, and one key piece as C.
Now fit these together to make the completed cross.
The solution is left to the reader.</p>

<p><a href="#f396">Fig. 396</a> shows a combination of six pieces which,
when fitted together, will make the Chinese cross
similar to <a href="#f392">Fig. 392</a>. Plane up the strip of hardwood
(birch preferred) so that it measures <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">2</span> in. square at the
end and proceed to mark out and make two pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
like D, two like E, one like F, and one piece like G.
Put the pieces together to form the Chinese cross.

<p><b>Square Puzzles</b> are of endless variety. Four of these
are shown, all simple to make, but not equally simple

5-ins. square piece of <span class="above">1</span>&#8260;<span class="below">8</span>-in. fretwood or plywood; or, if
preferred, pieces of different colour may be used. The
diagrams are given exactly half size, and the lines may
be set out direct on the wood. It will be noticed that
all four puzzles are strictly geometrical in character.</p>

<p><a href="#f397">Fig. 397</a> is made up of six pieces and is the simplest
of the group to solve. Although containing only five
pieces, <a href="#f398">Fig. 398</a> will be found to give more trouble.</p>

<p><a href="#f399">Fig. 399</a>, with ten pieces, is undoubtedly the most

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
